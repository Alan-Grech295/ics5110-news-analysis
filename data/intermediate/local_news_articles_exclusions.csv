By encouraging the use of private cars, the government would make the traffic situation on the island even worse, three party spokespeople told a press conference at the Marsa park-and-ride on Monday. Last week, the PN revealed that the government had ""secretly"" withdrawn plans to receive over €40 million in EU funding to spend on updating Malta's bus fleet. As a result, the private company that runs the public transport system said its plans to electrify Malta's bus fleet ""cannot go ahead"". In reply to questions by Times of Malta, Prime Minister Robert Abela confirmed the funds that were going to be used for the project will instead go to people to electrify their private cars. But for the PN, switching diesel-powered buses to electric ones would have been a crucial initiative to reduce emissions and combat climate change. ""Since these buses operate throughout the day on our roads, they should be the first priority in the electrification of Malta's vehicle fleet. ""Instead, Robert Abela made the meaningless decision to withdraw the allocation of these funds, leaving diesel buses on the roads while redirecting funds to more private cars, worsening traffic. This comes after the government reduced the grant for private electric cars in the recent budget from €11,000 to €8,000."" Spokespeople Mark Anthony Sammut, Ryan Callus, and Eve Borg Bonello told the media on Monday that the decision to withdraw from the €34 million agreement with the European Commission would also result in the loss of €7 million in EU funds for charging stations and another €50 million in private investment for cleaner air. ""This reckless decision by Abela confirms his lack of direction and how quality is discarded with every decision he makes. ""If he really needed to cut funds, Abela should have reduced wasteful spending on core government insiders and the corruption that has engulfed his administration,"" they said, adding that quality of life depended on clean air. They added that due to PL's incompetence, people's health will continue to suffer from the exhaust fumes of diesel-powered buses passing past pedestrians. ""The PN is the only solution for the Maltese people. We promise electrified mass transport that will not only reduce emissions on our roads but also provide an efficient and adequate service. ""Above all, we promise accountability and seriousness in public spending and in the use of European funds in the interest of the common good, not just for the privileged few."" PL reacts Reacting to the PN's press conference, the PL said in a statement the Opposition's true colours were revealed on Monday morning. ""Under a Nationalist government, the thousands of grants given for a person to switch from traditional fuel to electrification of a vehicle will no longer be given,"" the PL claimed. The party said that a Labour government will, on the other hand, continue providing incentives to those who opt for an electric vehicle. The incentives will not just apply to the purchase of a car but also when it comes to the registration and circulation tax relief from the road licence. ""Strong initiatives for those who make the choice to go for a private vehicle, with the least possible environmental damage."" That is the difference between austerity measures and incentivising people.",https://cdn-attachments.timesofmalta.com/d9afed3585f97c0ad8a1b9e4d69effd36a538a66-1733749387-397c9983-1920x1280.jpg,"PN spokespeople Ryan Callus, Mark Anthony Sammut and Eve Borg Bonello.

These inquiries determine civil or criminal liabilities, and their conclusions generally remain confidential. Times of Malta had reported that the bureau was delayed by the judiciary's hesitancy to share the contents of magisterial inquiries owing to the confidentiality of investigations and the privacy of those involved.  In April, Times of Malta also reported that the existing Road Safety Council, which brings together road safety stakeholders, had not met since appointing a new chairman five months previously.",https://cdn-attachments.timesofmalta.com/bf280bc20421e4393b874eb468d19a01255070b4-1734438585-2fca9fa2-1920x1280.jpeg,Doctors and insurers have complained about the delay in setting up a professional body to investigate the causes of traffic accidents.

In a statement it praised the police for mounting 170 road checks, inspecting 4,700 vehicles, and issuing more than 400 fines during the Christmas period. But it insisted that such measures should not be limited to the festive season.    ""The risks associated with drink and drug-driving are not confined to the holiday season. Road safety should never be treated as a seasonal concern; it must remain a priority every single day,"" the association stressed in a statement.   ""The fact that no serious traffic accidents were reported during this festive season was a testament to the effectiveness of these measures, it said.  ""While we wholeheartedly support these actions, we must also express our disappointment that similar roadside checks and initiatives are not conducted consistently throughout the year - drivers choosing to endanger their lives and those of innocent road users should face robust and unrelenting deterrence year-round,"" it said.  The association welcomed the use of breathalyser tests, which identified 11 drivers over the legal alcohol limit over the festive period, but it said tests should not be limited to drink-driving as drug-driving had become another menace on Malta's roads. It therefore urged the police to embark on drug roadside testing - in addition to alcohol testing - without further delay. It also called for the urgent appointment of a long-promised Transport Safety Investigative Commission, which should have been up and running by the end of 2023.

Following a magisterial inquiry into the case, several people had been charged over the incident. These were MFCC directors Chris Vassallo, Nazzareno Vassallo and Gerald Borg, CEO Anita Mifsud and projects manager Mark Anthony Farrugia.  They pleaded not guilty to involuntarily causing serious injuries to worker Emanuel Ronayne through their negligence. They were also charged with involuntarily causing slight injuries to other workers, causing damages to Nexos Ltd and RVC Ltd and breaching the Occupational Health and Safety Act.  Magistrate Caroline Farrugia Frendo heard how, on the day, workers were fixing lighting and other cables onto a metal arch ahead of the rock concert. The metal arch collapsed. Ronayne was passing some cables when it happened and he felt a ""sudden massive blow"" that resulted in him suffering from perforated lungs, a ruptured spleen, fractured ribs on his left side as well as fractures to several vertebrae.  The magistrate heard several witnesses testify how the arch had been put in place in 2006. It was used to affix lighting and screens and could be moved around depending on the needs of the event being organised. It moved on wheels that ran on rails and had to be dragged with fork lifters. The same procedure of moving the arch had been used since it was set up. A couple of days before the incident the arch had been moved according to the needs of the rock concert. Usually, lighting was then fixed according to an approved plan agreed on by Nexos, RVC and MFCC and under the supervision of an architect. In this case, the approved plan had not yet been supplied and the architect had not been appointed to supervise the works. The magistrate ruled that, although responsible for the company, this did not mean that the accused were criminally responsible for anything that happened there. She also noted that, according to court expert Alex Torpiano, the collapse was the result of three factors: the unbalanced loading of the arch, the way the arch was moved, and the contact between the arch's wheels and the concrete floor. It was not clear if one or all of these factors had caused the accident. Since the exact cause of the accident could not be pinned down, the court could not attribute blame to the directors of the MFCC or any of its workers.

Appearing on the program Il-Kazin fuq Tokis, set to air on Friday, Fenech discussed how schools could better utilise their facilities after normal hours.  ""We have invested a lot in schools,"" Fenech said, emphasising that school sports facilities often lay unused after the school day ends. He explained that children often leave school, complete their homework at home then head out again for extracurricular activities. This arrangement, he said, creates unnecessary traffic as parents ferry their children to different locations for activities. ""Why don't we focus all that energy on extending the school hours - but not on teachers?"" Fenech explained. He proposed that teachers would not be expected to take on additional responsibilities, but instead extracurricular educators such as football and tennis coaches and dance and drama instructors would be used instead. ""Why don't they become an integrated part of the educational system? That way, instead of children running around everywhere, they would be focused in one place,"" he added. Fenech suggested that after-school hours could also be used for children to complete their homework, ensuring they have more quality time with their families when they get home. He argued this would also align school and work hours, making life easier for parents and potentially reducing traffic. While noting that the Malta Union of Teachers (MUT) had previously opposed his proposal, however, Fenech did not discuss the reasons for the union's rejection during the discussion.  The debate surrounding school hours has gained traction following a recent study by the National Commission for the Promotion of Equality (NCPE) which highlighted the ""marked incompatibility"" between Malta's short school hours and the typical eight-hour workday.  The NCPE noted that Malta's school opening hours are among the shortest in the EU. In 2011, Roger Murphy, a professor of education at the University of Nottingham, told Times of Malta that Maltese students spend significantly less time in school compared to students in other developed countries. The MUT has disputed this claim. Last week, Education Minister Clifton Grima commented on the topic, saying: ""The education system should revolve around children's well-being. If we prioritise other things, we would be making a mistake."" Grima emphasised the importance of family time in a child's development, noting that children should be able to spend quality time at home. Fenech's proposal remains one of several ideas being floated to address the issue.",https://cdn-attachments.timesofmalta.com/514abb6070ab97865329680e08916fe91eb333d6-1737631060-f022a7bc-1920x1280.png,Tonio Fenech on the extension of school hours.

Replying to a parliamentary question by PL MP Katya De Giovanni, Jonathan Attard said 59 of the inquiries are pending before the Maltese courts and another five before the Gozo court.  De Giovanni also asked how many of the pending inquiries risked becoming time-barred.  However, Attard said only the magistrate conducting the in genere could answer the question.

However, this provision is often ignored and a new bill proposed by the government will extend this to six months. But magistrates will now have a hard two-year deadline to complete their work. Once the two years are up, the magistrate will have to send all the inquiry's material to the Attorney General, whether the inquiry is ready or not.

Cocaine was the most common drug found in post-mortem toxicology reports in 2024, according to data gathered by the Forensic Analysis Laboratory (FAL).  The FAL also found lidocaine which acts as a local anaesthetic which is used to ""trick the user"" as it creates a numbing effect, that is usually attributed to greater cocaine purity. The laboratory also found that a substance called pink cocaine or tucibi has garnered a lot of popularity, but it does not share any resemblance to traditional cocaine.

Malta's traffic woes are now the country's biggest problem, according to a new Times of Malta poll, narrowly edging out other concerns such as the cost of living, over-construction and corruption. The poll finds that when asked to name Malta's biggest problem, 28% of respondents pointed to the country's ongoing struggle with traffic, parking and public transport. This is the first time that traffic tops the list, which was typically been the domain of cost of living concerns in recent years. Traffic is also mentioned as one of the top concerns for individuals, with 15% saying that it is the issue that troubles them most on an individual basis. The findings come as the government mulls the introduction of a host of measures aimed at cutting down on congestion. But recent data suggests that transport minister Chris Bonett has his work cut out, with 27 new vehicles being added to Malta's roads each day. Cost of living worries dip but still linger Despite the dip in inflation over the past year, with Europe's cost-of-living crisis seemingly in the rearview mirror, the poll suggests that cost of living remains a major concern for many people. Cost of living is listed as the country's second-biggest problem, narrowly trailing traffic, with 27% of respondents saying that it is the issue that Malta most needs to address. But this nonetheless represents a dip from previous polls, in which it often topped the list with well over a third of respondents saying it was Malta's biggest concern. And the rising cost of living remains the issue that most impacts people on an individual level, with one in five saying that it is their biggest personal struggle, more than any other issue.  And, unlike most other previous polls, in which people of almost all ages listed corruption as one of the country's top concerns, only respondents over the age of 65 listed it amongst Malta's top three problems this time around. The poll, carried out by market research firm Esprimi, surveyed 600 people between January 30 and February 12. PN reacts: Transport one of government's biggest failures In a reaction to the survey findings, the Nationalist Party said it confirmed that transport was one of the government's biggest failures. ""Almost four years ago, just a few months before a general election, Labour presented the Metrò project, spending more than €2 million of taxpayers' money on it. As soon as the election was over, they scrapped it. Robert Abela and his colleagues always knew they were never going to implement this project, yet they were comfortable wasting public money just to make people believe they were going to solve all the problems. They misled the public using their own money,"" the party said.  ""Now, we are facing a situation where traffic is not only creating frustration and anger but is also leading to stress and anxiety. In addition, traffic is increasing air pollution in our country, negatively impacting our health and causing further economic damage."" The party reiterated its promises for the sector, including an efficient mass transport system, a stronger infrastructure, well planned roadworks, and incentives for those who choose to give up their car for a number of years in favour of alternative transport. Mark Anthony Sammut, shadow minister for transport, signed the statement.",https://cdn-attachments.timesofmalta.com/9205d1c15c054f7f51d505140f05aee83954d8a4-1739620008-4906072f-1920x1280.jpg,Malta is still struggling to deal with traffic congestion.

Aimed at reducing the number of cars on Malta's roads, the measure is expected to be announced soon alongside a number of other such policies. Licence holders who own a car and have been driving in Malta for at least seven years will be offered €5,000 a year for five years in exchange for giving up their licence.       Drivers who have a change of heart and decide they want their licence back during that time will have to pay an undisclosed penalty to do so.  The measure will only apply to owners of passenger cars - meaning motorbikes, commercial vans and other such vehicles will be excluded - and will apply to all car-owning drivers with seven years of experience, irrespective of age.  While policymakers privately acknowledge that they would like Maltese citizens to be the primary beneficiaries, anyone who qualifies will be eligible. Cabinet has already approved the measure but some of its detail is still being fleshed out, sources said.  One aspect which has yet to be clarified is what form the payment to applicants will take. Payments could be made in the form of cash grants, which would bump up government expenditure, or tax rebates, which would instead reduce government income.  Nevertheless, government sources said they are keen to introduce the measure this year.  The policy is among those forming the first phase of traffic-reducing measures pledged by Transport Minister Chris Bonett. Measures will continue to be rolled out across an 18-month period and are expected to cost tens of millions of euros in total.   Malta's problem with traffic is well-documented and official statistics lay out the extent of the problem.   As of the end of last year, there were 445,711 registered motor vehicles in Malta. Over 70 per cent of those, 313,665, were private cars, National Statistics Office data shows - a 20 per cent increase over the same figure a decade earlier, in 2014.  While the government has invested extensively in road infrastructure and subsidies to make public buses free of charge in the past years, attempts to limit the growing flow of traffic have been otherwise limited.  A much-promoted report into a metro system unveiled in 2021 proved to be a pre-electoral red herring and suggestions of dissuading drivers by introducing unpopular measures such as parking fees or congestion charges - or removing subsidies on fuel - have been shot down.  Offering drivers a cash incentive to turn in their licence is an unusual policy move, with few parallels globally. Far more common are car scrappage schemes, in which drivers are offered a cash or tax incentive to scrap old vehicles in favour of newer, less polluting ones. Malta has had such a scheme in place for years.   Policymakers admit that the €25,000 incentive will not be a silver bullet to solve traffic woes but argue that it is part of a broader series of measures intended to get cars off the road.  In an extensive interview last autumn, Bonett had also suggested finding ways of encouraging young people to not get a licence in the first place, increasing the use of ferries and introducing a new category of licence plate that would restrict drivers to using those vehicles at set days or times.  Soon after, Bonett formally unveiled several traffic-busting ideas for public feedback. The measures span all aspects of transportation, from cycling strategy documents to plans to overhaul Malta's public bus routes and are focused on incentivising behavioural change rather than punishing road users, the minister said.",https://cdn-attachments.timesofmalta.com/e1e88ef7164f3d91ef36d8d3eb12a9d7b2781103-1742653482-0b265aeb-1920x1280.jpg,The number of cars in Malta has been increasing steadily over the years.

The money could be much better spent on other initiatives to reduce traffic, a transport expert said yesterday. ""We know how to shift people away from cars,"" Suzanne Maas, who holds a PhD in sustainable mobility, said. ""Safer walking infrastructure, frequent crossings, protected bicycle paths, more shade, more frequent public transport, and possibly a bus rapid transit system are all ways to get people away from cars."" Removing Malta's generous fuel subsidies would also disincentivise car use, she said. Those solutions, however, would mean taking space away from cars and irking car owners, added Maas, who is also Friends of the Earth's climate campaign coordinator. ""That is something the government seems unwilling to do, so they would rather just throw money at the problem. ""To bring changes, you cannot only use the carrot; you need the stick as well. The solutions might not be popular at the start, but they work,"" she said. On Sunday, Times of Malta reported that the government plans to pay drivers €25,000 if they give up their licence for five years. Sources said that licence holders who own a car and have been driving in Malta for at least seven years will be offered €5,000 a year for five years. The measure is expected to be announced soon alongside a number of other such policies designed to reduce traffic on Malta's congested roads. Like Maas, Jonathan Sammut, an MCAST lecturer and alternative mobility activist, called for more disincentives as a way of doing so. ""If the government wants to promote alternative means of commuting and discourage use of personal cars, anyone who studied economics ‒ even if just at O level ‒ would say that the first thing that would need to be done is to remove the subsidies on fuel. You don't subsidise something that you want people to make less use of,"" he said. Others, including Adrian Galea, who heads Malta's insurers' lobby, questioned whether the €25,000 handout would only entice people who have already stopped driving. He asked whether all licence holders, irrespective of age, usage and so on, would qualify, and what controls the authorities intend putting in place to curb any abuse. ""What matters most is that this measure is not considered as a path to easy money by selling or giving up your licence when the licence holder seldom uses the car or wasn't a user anyway. It would be very difficult to ascertain this as data is probably lacking,"" Galea said. He added that effective enforcement would be needed for the policy to succeed in taking cars off the road, comparing it to the government's lack of willingness to tackle drunk and drug driving. ""We are now being bombarded with reports about the [easy] availability of drugs ‒ not just cannabis ‒ which sadly is another concern on top of alcohol consumption before driving. It is very clear that the government's apathy or unwillingness at tackling this issue will continue to have its effect on road safety. ""Introducing measures such as this exchange of licences for payments will only succeed if properly enforced."" Meanwhile, most commenters on social media and the Times of Malta comments board expressed doubts over the plan. ""I would have imposed a limit on drivers over 65 years of age, since these are already potentially not going to work on a daily basis and thus are not the major contributors to traffic, especially during peak hours,"" K. Zahra said. ""So I get €25,000, drive without the licence and when I get caught, I'll pay the fine,"" another woman commented on Instagram. Others said that before ditching their private car, suitable alternatives are needed. ""I'm ready to do it... but the public transport needs to be up to standard. If the bus says it will pass at 12:10, it needs to pass at 12:10."" Others pointed out the initiatives would mostly benefit non-Maltese residents who decide to go home after receiving the money. Among them was former PN shadow transport minister Adrian Delia. ""So foreign drivers who have been around for seven years will get a smashing bonus of €25,000 to go back home,"" Delia, who had the health portfolio in the PN's shadow cabinet last year, said. Malta's problem with traffic is well-documented and official statistics lay out the extent of the problem.  As of the end of last year, there were 445,711 registered motor vehicles on the islands.

He also said he would not be implementing any of the incentives until at least April because ""we must get this right"". The following month, Times of Malta revealed that the government was also planning on introducing a park-and-ride system to ease congestion in areas known as severe traffic hot spots. Then in November, the transport ministry unveiled its ideas and asked the public for feedback. The ministry is expected to unveil the final measures in the coming days.",https://cdn-attachments.timesofmalta.com/52bad0cf0aeb3869a37e49616aa2a636a8ec0b8e-1743161797-7f373202-1920x1280.jpg,"Would teens opt for a light motorcycle instead of a car if they get €1,500 in return?

The figure equates to less than one per cent of all driving licences issued in Malta, according to figures provided in parliament two years ago. Last week, Transport Minister Chris Bonett announced a slew of measures to tackle the perennial issue of traffic blighting Malta's roads. Among the measures were plans to offer €25,000 to motorists willing to give up their car for five years and €6,000 to those opting to ride a motorcycle instead for four years. But experts Times of Malta spoke to expressed doubts in the effectiveness of the licence measures - and others floated by the ministry. Bonett told reporters that the government intended to spend between €10 and €15 million to implement all the various measures being planned, which also include new bus routes, grants for motorcycles and carpooling tax incentives. A Transport Ministry spokesperson on Tuesday stressed the €15 million budget ""refers to the allocation for the measures being implemented and paid for till the end of this year"". He said, ""It does not take into account additional initiatives currently under discussion where key variables still need to be finalised and costed,"" adding the government was ""committed towards instilling a culture change in the transport sector"". Assuming the maximum amount is allocated and that all that money is allocated to people who choose to swap cars for motorcycles, 2,500 car drivers will be taken off the road. The figure was calculated by dividing the total €15 million budget by the €6,000 cost of incentivising a driver to exchange their car for a motorbike for four years. Just 600 car drivers taken off roads Transport academic Suzanne Maas noted that if that €15 million budget is used on the €25,000 incentive for drivers, just 600 car drivers will be taken off Maltese roads. ""And that's if they allocate the entire €15 million to the licences,"" she said. ""If they allocate only a third of the budget, that would only be 200 drivers... Is that going to make much of a difference?"" She added it was unrealistic to expect the government to spend the entire budget on licensing measures, given that other measures in the proposals will also require funding to put into practice. ""The licence scheme will take so much money and have little effect... It's so much money given to so few people,"" said Maas.  He said Pembroke - one of the areas slated for a park and ride - had been earmarked for such use ""for years now, but it's been a total failure"". And he questioned whether government sites would have enough spaces to accommodate public parking. Expressing doubts on shifting services to off-peak hours, he noted that, even if rubbish was collected at night, for example, ""people, especially in touristic areas, will still be walking past bags of rubbish when out for an evening walk"". 'Drastic measures' Meanwhile, questioning the effectiveness of measures to improve take-up of public transport, Galea asked why traffic did not appear to have reduced following transport becoming free.   Asked whether his locality would be able to free up parking spaces for motorbikes, the St Paul's Bay mayor said there were already ""many more vehicles than car parking spaces available"" in the busy tourist location.   ""Unless we talk about drastic measures - which no government seems willing to do - we can't get far on this"".  Asked about which drastic measures he could be referring to, Galea suggested looking into the possibility of limiting the number of cars with one person inside entering Valletta - in a bid to encourage carpooling - and said paid parking spaces could disincentivise car use. Pedestrianised streets and banning SUVs Maas, who holds a PhD in sustainable mobility from the University of Malta, noted that while ""some measures are good"" she expressed doubts about those focused on creating more parking spaces, stressing such measures instead ""invited car use"". The academic noted that high streets only open to buses and pedestrians were ""very common abroad"" and said consumers were less likely to frequent areas with more cars, noting that removing cars from some areas could increase commercial high street activity. Maas - a Friends of the Earth Malta campaign organiser - said the government should consider limiting the number of cars per household and ""definitely"" limit the number of cars nationwide. She also called for a ban on large vehicles such as SUVs. ""Restrictions are definitely needed,"" said Maas.",https://cdn-attachments.timesofmalta.com/1704cdedaf153e90545ec145104af4abd549a95c-1743523821-f7089e09-1920x1280.jpg,Suzanne Maas (left inset) and Ċensu Galea (right inset) questioned whether the number of drivers taken off the road would make much difference.

Speaking in a Times Talk episode that will be released next week, the Transport Minister said that after consulting with classic car enthusiasts he realised he ""may have jumped the gun"" when he announced the measure. ""I admit we were a bit hasty with that measure. I don't mind admitting that, and I don't think it's a sign of weakness to admit a mistake. Rather, it shows you're serious,"" he said. ""I still agree with the measure but I may have jumped the gun when I announced it. We want to protect the hobby of vintage cars while making sure nobody abuses the system."" Currently, cars that are older than 30 years are exempted from annual licence fees and must only pay an annual €8 administrative fee, provided the vehicle does not exceed 3,000 kilometres per year. Vintage vehicles are marked on Maltese roads with a black number plate. But the authorities observed that some drivers were passing off their old cars as 'vintage', managing to pay very low licence fees for a car they use every day and which is not a classic car at all. Moreover, 'hundreds' of old, second-hand vehicles are being imported every year and registered as vintage cars but used as ordinary cars for every day transportation by abusing the loophole in the system. Last week, as part of a raft of measures aimed at tackling Malta's chronic traffic congestion, Bonett announced the government would curb vintage car abuse by introducing a measure that stipulates that vehicles must be 35 years old to qualify for a black number plate and that they will be subject to inspections. But during the filming of Times Talk on Thursday, Bonett told Times of Malta he will amend that measure and that he takes full responsibility for the oversight. ""We're not after people's hobbies,"" he said. ""We only need to make sure that the fees for classic car enthusiasts are not abused by people who want to keep their junk cars on the road."" Later on Thursday the Minister said on Facebook that there was an agreement on the decision following a meeting with the Maltese Vintage Vehicle Federation.  ""The purpose of the meeting was to understand where we want to go as a Government, to remove from our roads ordinary cars that are being used under the guise of being 'vintage' and abusing the system, while protecting those who invest in truly classic cars,"" he wrote. ""We agreed on everything, and in the coming weeks, after the necessary legal work is done, we will announce how the reform, which everyone agrees we need, will work. ""What I can anticipate from now is that we are satisfied that we can achieve our goal without raising the car age requirement from 30 to 35 years. In fact, we will introduce measures that will strengthen this hobby."" Unplanned measures - PN One hour after the Nationalist Party held a press conference in Msida on Thursday criticising the government's proposals, transport minister Chris Bonett admitted he had changed his mind about the vintage car scheme, the Opposition said.

What if people take up the €25,000 offer, give up their car and then take a cab everywhere? Wouldn't that mean no cars were effectively taken off the roads?  And what if most people who take up that offer are elderly who were about to stop driving soon anyway, or people who seldom use their car, or drive only in their neighbourhood or village? These people are not causing the traffic problem, so they will hardly solve congestions by giving up their licence and taking the hefty grant. And is he comfortable asking young people to switch to motorcycles instead of cars? Would he want his own children riding motorbikes on roads often that are often dangerous? In the podcast, which will be released on Wednesday, Bonett acknowledged he will likely not solve the traffic problems but vowed to bring about a culture shift in the way people travel. He said that while immediate solutions are hard to come by, these are only short-term measures to tackle Malta's traffic woes, and a broader, mass transportation system is needed in the long term. Bonett said he would like people to rethink their relationship with cars, and fincnacial incentives are one way he wants to get there. ""Even if one person takes up a scheme that would already be an improvement,"" he said. He said he is ready to consider other options but remains firm on not introducing measures that discourage people from using their cars.

The plan, initially proposed in the Labour council's manifesto in 2024, would see the entire length of Xatt is-Sajjieda closed to traffic at the weekends. But this plan hinges on a long-planned construction of a new road connecting Triq Lepanto with Triq il-Kavallerizza in the south of the town, which would allow for traffic to be easily diverted away from the seafront. Construction of the road may now proceed, after the Planning Authority gave the go-ahead for the relocation of an old barumbara - a structure intended to house pigeons or doves - overlooking the proposed road. However, independent councillor Matthew Bugeja told Times of Malta that the council should not wait for the removal of the barumbara and the construction of the road, which could take years. Moreover, several environmental and conservation NGOs have come out against the relocation of the building, arguing that the project will damage its historical integrity and set a dangerous precedent for conservation. In the meantime, Bugeja has proposed an alternative plan for this summer that would serve as a pilot project to show the government that the idea is viable. This would involve only the partial pedestrianisation of Xatt Is-Sajjieda in the evenings, a 200-metre area stretching from the intersection with Triq Duncan to that with Triq San Frangisk. Traffic would be diverted away from the road via Triq Barthelemy and Triq San Frangisk, before rejoining Xatt is-Sajjieda.

In its complaint, PN argued that while the government's measures were presented in two segments on the March 29 evening news bulletin, receiving a total of eight minutes of coverage, the Opposition's reaction was not given similar prominence.

The worker suffered severe leg injuries in an accident on August 4 2009 as he worked on the unloading of containers off a ship. He was 52 years old at the time and was wearing safety equipment provided by the Malta Dockers' Union. The man requested payment of damages and eventually sued Malta Freeport Terminals Ltd and shipowners CMA.  He passed away on January 2, 2013. On May 16, 2019, the First Hall of the Civil Court held Malta Freeport Terminals Limited responsible for the injuries and the disability the worker had suffered due to those injuries. It ordered the company to pay the plaintiff €34,648.50 in damages. Back then, his wife, who entered into the suit after he died, appealed the judgment, arguing that the amount was incorrect. She argued that tax and social security contributions should not have been deducted from the damages awarded and questioned whether there was a mistake in the calculation made by the first court. The Court of Appeal held that the court of first instance was wrong when it deducted income tax and the social security contributions from the compensation, as this benefited the respondents and not the plaintiff. As for the calculation of compensation, the Court of Appeal held that it should have been based on the period when Fenech could not work, between August 5, 2009 and April 24, 2011, as well as the period when he returned to work until his death, since Fenech suffered a disability from which he did not recover. The Court of Appeal therefore revoked the €34,648.50 in damages awarded by the first court, and instead awarded the widow €106,816.

We don't want it to simply be an exercise in handing out money. We want to target people who will contribute to reducing traffic,"" the minister said.  Bonett suggested that young people could be the first to be eligible for the offer.   ""The number of young people who want to get their driving licence as soon as they turn 18 is still alarmingly high,"" he said.   The minister said that several objectives had been completed, including shifting services such as road cleansing and landscaping away from peak hours, and an increase in public transport routes.   Training has also started on TM Roads, the government's new online platform that will be used to improve efficiency, collaboration and transparency on road works.  Bonett said some other plans were running slightly behind schedule, but would be completed in the next week or two. He cited a park-and-ride facility for Paola and new circular bus routes in Paola and Siggiewi, and the launch of a national cycling strategy as examples.  Bonett said that by September, customer-facing government departments would start offering services after 9am. The shift to a later starting time is intended to reduce rush hour traffic on local roads.  A study on the feasibility of a cargo ferry between the Freeport and Gozo will be completed by September, as will a green travel policy that will encourage government workers to commute to work without using their cars.   Asked for a timeline on the start of a ferry service connecting Sliema, Bugibba and Gozo, Bonett said more details would be provided at the launch of the ferry terminal in Bugibba on Wednesday.   Bonett stressed that the measures were not meant to achieve ""sensationalist"" goals such as a huge reduction in traffic overnight, but to change the public's attitude towards cars.   ""A culture change is not something that happens overnight - it takes time. I want the next generation to be less car-dependent,"" he said.",https://cdn-attachments.timesofmalta.com/2f91a1a7d1a58be88760a6d95cc89f093f6f3a5f-1751291687-aa4068ed-1920x1280.jpg,"Transport Minister Chris Bonett (centre) said the government did not want the offer of €25,000 to be an exercise in handing out money with no end result.

On Tuesday, 59-year-old Dione Galdes died after succumbing to injuries he suffered in an accident in Cirkewwa on Sunday. He was an experienced dive instructor from Iklin who was widely respected in the diving community. Diver David Agius said Galdes was given first-aid attention on the pavement in the sun, in front of other divers. Agius, who runs the diving community website divinginfo.mt, said that it was an unfortunate accident that happened in around two metres of water prior to the actual dive starting. The diving community has repeatedly said that the Cirkewwa Marine Park does not have a proper first-aid centre, and it has previously appealed for two rooms to be used as a first-aid centre. When news that Galdes suffered serious injuries spread on Sunday, Agius sent an email to the prime minister and the concerned authorities flagging the poor conditions in which Galdes received first-aid care. ""All treatment in full view of arriving local divers, diving tourists and passersby for close to 30 minutes, being given CPR in almost 40 degrees of sun until an ambulance from Mater Dei arrived,"" the email read. As this happened in public, Agius added that this scene also poorly affected divers mentally. The email reminded the government of the possibility of having two rooms, located next to the divers' bathrooms at Cirkewwa Marine Park, serve as a first aid room and a site office for park managers. Currently, these rooms are owned by Transport Malta and leased out to Gozo Channel Operations Ltd.  In April, the website uploaded an article highlighting the shortcomings of first-aid availability on-site. The article explained that first aiders and park managers stay in a rented container in the summer. However, they are unable to rent this in winter due to storms that may hit the area. First aid equipment - AED and spinal board - are located outside the divers' bathrooms, exposed to the sun and rain, it said. Besides this, the park lacks places where proper treatment can be administered, it added. ""A better equipped first aid room might provide access to better and more advanced first aid equipment and conditions that may allow better recovery opportunities and/or at least, privacy,"" the article wrote. The article referred to a similar incident in October 2024, where a British diver who died after succumbing to injuries was also given CPR for almost 30 minutes outside. The website, in May, announced that it had collected 236 signatures from the diving community, calling for the rooms to be used as a health centre and office.

He was speaking during a press conference held at the busy Aldo Moro Road in Marsa, alongside the shadow minister for the infrastructure Joseph Giglio. They noted that over recent months, Transport Minister Chris Bonett announced a series of measures aimed at tackling the traffic crisis. Some of these were meant to be implemented by the end of June but, as the minister himself confirmed, they ""got stuck in traffic."" Among these initiatives were a park-and-ride project in several localities, and a proposal to offer €25,000 to individuals who surrender their driving licence for five years. However, the minister had earlier this week revealed that the latter initiative had not yet progressed and the government had yet to finalise which demographic it would target first.   Sammut said the initiative had been announced before proper studies and costings were made. ""No deadlines have been met. This was launched without proper studies or costing,"" Sammut said. He recalled that less than a month ago, the minister also went into reverse gear over plans to raise the threshold for vintage car classification by five years to 35. Similarly, a proposed ferry service to Bugibba, promised for summer, had still not materialised, with June now over. ""This government is not following a clear plan, it is managing by crisis,"" he said, also pointing to massive inconvenience caused by simultaneous, uncoordinated roadworks in areas such as Cirkewwa, St Paul's Bay, Golden Bay and St Julian's. He argued that this reflected a basic lack of traffic management. Giglio echoed the sentiment, accusing the government of selling propaganda rather than delivering real results. ""Despite all the announcements, the impact on the roads has not matched the minister's claims,"" he said. ""All we need to do is look around us every day. There is confusion, a sense of crisis management.

The European Semester Report, which traces Malta's progress across a range of sectors, was presented to MCESD on Wednesday. The report points to a raft of measures unveiled earlier this year, singling out proposals to offer cash incentives to people willing to give up their cars or driving licences, or those willing to switch to small motorcycles. These measures ""still favour rewards over sanctions,"" the report says. Meanwhile, promises to create new parking facilities ""will further encourage car use, leading to increased congestion"". The report notes that ""measures to tackle congestion by disincentivising the use of private cars...are not foreseen"". ""Policies in place to address traffic congestion have been predominately incentive-based and largely ineffective,"" the report says. Its authors also say that measures to improve public road transport and alternative modes of mobility ""seem to be systematically lacking,"" with a 2024 ban on rental e-scooters further reducing options for alternative mobility. Government figures say the proposals unveiled earlier in the year are short-term, voluntary initiatives intended to encourage a cultural shift towards alternative modes of transport, with longer-term measures (including a mass transit system) set to follow. Meanwhile, recently announced plans to extend Malta's sea transport network have broadly met with public approval. The report explores several other areas of Malta's social and economic development, heaping praise on the country's economic performance but flagging several broader concerns. Economic growth is expected to continue, with Malta's low unemployment figures likely to remain stable. Meanwhile, the country's deficit is likely to dip at a faster rate than expected, with the country's debt-to-GDP ratio well within the EU's recommended margins. However, Malta remains highly dependent on fossil fuels, with one of the lowest rates of renewable energy uptake across the EU. Malta's blanket energy subsidies ""hinder electrification"" and should be phased out in favour of further investment in green investments and strengthening grid capacity, the report says. Meanwhile, poverty is rising among specific groups, including children, non-EU nationals, and older adults. Policy measures to address poverty among vulnerable groups have yet to yield results, the report suggests. And Malta still faces long-standing problems of court delays and skills shortages, with ""systemic shortcomings"" in Malta's educational system resulting in ""persistently insufficient basic skills,"" as well as low enrolment of tertiary students in STEM subjects. Positive report but several 'areas for improvement': MCESD In a statement, MCESD said the report highlights ""a strong and dynamic Maltese economy but points to areas requiring improvement"". The Council outlined the call for Malta to invest more in research and development, as well as to cut transport emissions and tackle traffic congestion.

In a statement Friday, the party urged ""immediate action"" on the issue, saying it ""fully supports"" a call by Mater Dei emergency department doctor Jonathan Joslin for random testing of road users. Joslin made the appeal after three people died in three separate accidents on Sunday, calling the lack of legal provision for such testing ""one of the most critical gaps in current road safety enforcement"". Momentum said the introduction of random testing - not requiring reasonable suspicion - was ""not just a necessary step, it is long overdue"". ""Too many lives have been shattered, too many families left broken, and too many near-misses ignored. Road safety in Malta cannot wait for another tragedy. We must act with urgency and determination"", the party said. ""Momentum stands firmly behind the implementation of random testing, in line with proven international best practices that have saved lives across Europe."" The party stressed that driving while under the influence of alcohol or drugs was ""not a 'personal choice'; it is a public threat"". ""Random testing is not about punishing people, it is about deterrence, about prevention, and about protecting innocent lives. Allowing reckless behaviour on our roads to go unchecked is something we should all be worried about."" Momentum committee member Matthew Agius said that while the party was encouraged by growing awareness of the issue, ""awareness without action is meaningless"". ""It is time for Parliament, authorities, and enforcement agencies to rise to the occasion and introduce a robust, transparent and fair system of random roadside testing, one that is backed by law, supported by technology, and enforced consistently."" The party emphasised placing a ""culture of responsibility, accountability, and safety"" at the centre of transport policy, warning there was ""no room for complacency"". It called on the government to fast-track legal changes to combat the issue and advocated for roads to be built to encourage motorists to drive slower.

The locality saw some 240 accidents, followed by Birkirkara and Qormi, which saw 226 and 210 cases respectively, the National Statistics Office (NSO) said. Nationwide, there were more than 4,000 traffic accidents in the second quarter of the year, a reduction of nine per cent compared to the same period the year before. With one third of accidents, some 1,366 cases, the Northern Harbour District - comprising localities such as Sliema, St Julian's, Birkirkara and Qormi - was the most accident-prone. There were five fatalities from traffic incidents in the second quarter of the year, all in June, while 108 people were left grievously injured, including 73 drivers, 13 passengers and 22 others, such as pedestrians and cyclists.  Thursdays were the worst for road traffic casualties, amounting to 58, while Tuesdays were the worst for accidents overall, seeing some 645 cases, or 16% of the total. Motorists were most likely to have accidents in the mornings between the hours of 9am and midday, when there were more 884 cases, while 3am to 6am was the safest time to be on the roads, accounting for just 33 incidents. Some 13 cyclists were involved in traffic accidents, one fatally. Three suffered grievous injuries and nine suffered slight injuries. So far this year, 17 people have died on Malta's roads.

Omar Alhamdoalgorsh, 27, was accused of driving without a licence and insurance cover, breaching bail conditions and recidivism. Alhamdoalgorsh was caught after being stopped by community police and Transport Malta officials carrying out traffic inspections on Triq Burmarrad in St Paul's Bay, police inspector Warren Galea told a court Tuesday. The officers asked the accused for a licence and he said he did not have one. The sergeant contacted the Police's control room and was informed that Alhamdoalgorsh's licence was suspended until September 12. He was also informed that the man signs the bail book at Qawra Police Station. The man was arrested and arraigned in court on Tuesday afternoon. He confirmed he would plead guilty. While hearing submissions on punishment, the police inspector said this was the second time Alhamdoalgorsh was caught driving without a licence and the law was clear. The inspector said that while the man had adhered to his bail conditions, this incident led to a breach since he committed a crime while out on bail. Galea added that the man regretted having driven without a licence. Defence lawyer Noel Bianco said the man miscalculated and thought the suspension had elapsed and that he was clear to get back behind the wheel. He was also on his way to work when caught driving without a licence. The court fined him €5,500 and disqualified him from having a driving licence for 18 months, beginning after the current suspension elapses on September 12. The court ordered the forfeiture of €1,000 from his personal guarantee but did not revoke his bail. ""In these circumstances, you should really be careful. With all these incidents around us caused by the lack of care for traffic regulations, you should really be careful,"" Magistrate Jean Paul Grech warned the man before he left the courtroom.

Unlike previous year's this will not be SiGMA's main event, it will be a smaller event that is expected to attract 15,000 people. The main event is being held in Milan this year. Last year, SiGMA's main conference attracted around 27,000 delegates. This large event drew criticism for exacerbating traffic congestion, particularly around Marsa, where the conference was held. Despite the complaints, the Traffic Ministry had insisted that its traffic management plan worked. During a media briefing on Wednesday, Transport Malta CEO Kurt Farrugia reiterated that last year's plan worked well, and overall, TM plans on implementing a very similar traffic management plan. The main difference is that more TM officials will be deployed on the first day of the event, and the white taxi drop-off and pick-up point has moved. Just like last year, TM plans on implementing a geo-fenced area for ride-hailing cabs, meaning that Y-plate taxis will not be able to drop off or pick up anyone within the general area of the event. Instead, ride-hailing cabs will have a designated pick-up and drop-off spot, on the other side of Triq il-Labour in ONE News' parking lot. Attendees will have to walk for about five minutes and cross the bridge over the main road to reach the event. White taxis will have a separate drop-off and pick-up zone located along the road in front of Identità's office. Chauffeur-driven cabs will use Addolorata Cemetery's parking area as private parking for their cabs. While anyone catching a coach or mini-bus will be dropped off and picked up on Triq tat-Tromba, which is a seven-minute walk from the venue. Otherwise, staff personnel will have their own designated parking closer to the venue. Besides these different zones, TM officials will be patrolling the area and making use of drones to best monitor the traffic. In an interview with Times of Malta last year, prime minister Robert Abela said that the Malta Maritime Hub is not a viable venue and pledged to find a better venue to host this conference.

The accident happened on July 19, 2024, when Falzon and her friends were sunbathing in the area of Munxar, beneath the ruins of an 18th-century military battery known as Rihama. Speaking to Times of Malta, Falzon's parents, Michael and Charmaine, said that while they have heard from government sources that the magisterial inquiry into their daughter's death has likely been concluded, they are none the wiser as to whether this is true.   Mirabelle's noisiness was a core part of her character. ""She would be in the yard with her boyfriend, and I'd tell her, 'Does everyone need to know what you're saying?' She was always laughing, bringing joy wherever she went. Now the house is silent without her,"" Charmaine said. On the one-year anniversary of Mirabelle's death, her parents organised a mass in her honour. ""I can't thank people enough for coming. The place was packed - everyone still loves her."" Finally, Mirabelle's father said he had just one request to the authorities. ""When someone brings something to your attention, don't let months and years go by before action is taken. If you save just one life, it's enough. This is a small country - things shouldn't fall on deaf ears. No one is infallible and it's impossible for everything to be perfect, but there are things we could be doing better.""

493121,https://timesofmalta.com/article/minimum-three-years-jail-drunk-drugged-drivers-guilty-manslaughter.1115894,Times of Malta,https://timesofmalta.com,"Minimum three years' jail for drunk, drugged drivers guilty of manslaughter","The judiciary cannot provide a lesser punishment, says draft legislation soon to be debated in parliament",Daniel Ellul,09/09/2025,"A driver found guilty of mans-laughter while under the influence of drugs or alcohol will face a minimum sentence of three years' effective imprisonment, according to draft legislation. The government had previously announced mandatory prison sentences for involuntary homicide if a driver kills someone either while over the alcohol limit or with any drugs in their system. The recently published draft legislation, and soon to be debated in parliament, establishes a minimum sentence. ""Where an offence against sub-article 1 or 2 (involuntary homicide) is committed by reason of the offender having driven a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or drugs, a minimum punishment of three years' imprisonment shall apply in every case,"" the draft legislation reads. Currently, the law imposes a maximum sentence of four years' imprisonment if a person is killed out of negligence, and a 10-year sentence if more than one is killed or injured. The draft law further explicitly states that the judiciary cannot provide a lesser punishment than the minimum sentence. It also adds that the Probation Act cannot apply in cases of drink or drug driving. Last week, the government announced it plans to start random roadside testing for drink and drug driving. It also announced its intention to introduce mandatory prison sentences for behind-the-wheel manslaughter if the driver was over the alcohol limit or had drugs in their system.   When the law is in force, the police will be equipped with handheld drug tests, which check for the seven types of illegal drugs and their derivatives. To conduct the test, the police officer needs to scrape the driver's tongue with a swab, which is then inserted into a plastic holder before being inserted into the testing device. If there is a positive result, the next step is to take another sample to confirm the results - this time via a saliva swab that is tested in a lab. However, the draft legislation published last week also accounts for cases when a driver is unconscious following an accident. In such circumstances, where a driver cannot consent to an oral exam, the police, following a magistrate's order, will have the power to conduct a blood test. The blood test, conducted by a medical professional, will only happen following a magistrate's order, the law states. ""The idea is that if a driver is unconscious or unable to give the oral exam, or cannot give consent for the exam, there is still something to test if drugs or alcohol are in the system,"" according to a source working on the legislation. Another provision requires prosecutors to request that an accused's driver's licence be suspended if they are facing charges of vehicular manslaughter. ""The decree of the Court of Magistrates shall be immediately enforceable but shall be subject to an appeal by an application filed within five (5) days before the Criminal Court,"" the proposed law states. The court's decision may be revised and/or made subject to conditions the court deems fit. The legislation is being pushed after a series of road incidents sparked by drink or drug driving this summer, some of which have been fatal. The Authority for the Responsible Use of Cannabis is in favour of the government's drive to introduce roadside alcohol and drug testing. But it has recommended that roadside drug testing focus on whether a driver is under the effects of cannabis, rather than whether there is any trace of it in the body, because ""it is impairment that poses a real risk to road safety"".",https://cdn-attachments.timesofmalta.com/10424ff7da702da83ca36975f5c02bb351eef402-1757353591-05a18bc0-1920x1280.jpeg,The roadside kits to be used by the police.

Veteran contractor Albert Tanti, who has been in the building business for nearly four decades, criticised current Transport Malta regulations, telling Times of Malta that ""animals are treated better than construction workers"" because while horses are banned from working during peak hours, protections for construction workers are much weaker.   Transport Malta sticks to its guns Transport Malta has no intention of changing the regulations. In a reply to questions, a spokesperson defended the authority's policy, arguing the 9.30am restriction is essential to reduce traffic congestion ""during peak morning hours when thousands commute to work, school or to obtain other services"". ""Closing residential streets earlier would risk significant disruption to traffic flow and limit emergency access,"" he said. He said the authority does, however, consider exceptions on a case-by-case basis. In areas where a closure wouldn't affect schools or traffic flow, a permit might be granted for an earlier start.  He said the authority is open to discussing specific cases with contractors to find practical solutions. ""Where possible, Transport Malta seeks to assist works through measures such as temporary permits, phased closures or coordination with local councils to balance community needs and workers' safety,"" he said. But Tanti and the building contractors' association argue that due to the policy, workers often do not begin work until 11am - the hottest part of the day - due to the time it takes to set up and get materials on site. He said starting work later also means they must finish later. Working at night would hardly solve the problem and would create even more inconveniences for residents, he added. Allowing contractors to close side streets at 7am would be in everyone's best interest, including the neighbours, he insisted, because the site would be completed earlier. And even with an earlier permit, they would not be able to start the actual work before 8am anyway, giving commuters a clear window before they leave for work, he said.",https://cdn-attachments.timesofmalta.com/1e27a26ee9ad9be39b661bef42d5348db57f2cf9-1757154635-f00f4c15-1920x1280.jpeg,Albert Tanti is a veteran contractor who has been in the building business for nearly four decades.,2025-09-11 08:57:09.346024+00,"{Construction,National,Traffic}",{}

""I'm hoping that, in a few weeks, we will be announcing it. It's not going to take months; it's a matter of some finishing touches,"" the minister said. Bonett announced the 'Surrender Your Licence' scheme in March, explaining that it will offer car drivers an annual payment of €5,000 for five years in exchange for giving up their driving licence during that period. At the time, he set himself a deadline of the end of June. However, at the end of June, Bonett said the scheme was yet to be finalised.  The transport minister said the government's plan to reduce traffic, announced earlier this year, is still under way. Yesterday, Bonett also gave an update on plans for a new ferry connection to Gozo from Sliema and St Paul's Bay. In July, the minister announced that the government had issued a call for a tender, adding that the year-round  service was expected to start ""between the middle and end of August"". But the ambitious plan to launch the fast ferry service this summer ran aground after a ferry company complained that the tender included deadlines and conditions that go against EU rules.

Infrastructure Malta (IM) attributed the delays mainly to the installation of new sewage pipes. Mosta mayor Joseph Gatt told Times of Malta such setbacks are common in large projects, particularly since no works had been carried out on this road for 30 years. He said the reconstruction should finally be completed within a ""maximum"" of two weeks. For nine months, IM has been rebuilding Triq il-Bidnija, which is the main road connecting the village to Mosta. A noticeboard on site states that the project was scheduled to last 18 weeks from its start on January 30, meaning it should have been completed by early June. Residents who spoke to Times of Malta on condition of anonymity complained about the inconvenience caused by the delay. Up until Friday, drivers entering Bidnija from Mosta were allowed to pass through Triq il-Bidnija via a one-way lane. However, residents leaving the village to go towards Mosta were forced to use a narrow concrete country road. Traffic lights were also put up to help direct the traffic. After Times of Malta sent questions to IM, a resident said the traffic lights were taken down and Triq il-Bidnija was opened up for two-way traffic. Works are still ongoing further up the road towards Bidnija church.  Despite the progress, a resident said the roadworks have ""been moving slowly for a considerable number of months"". Apart from causing inconvenience, a resident said the unfinished road generates a lot of dust, which was even making its way into his home. ""It has been a nightmare,"" the resident said. ""Every time a car passes, it raises a cloud of dust that even enters our homes. With school about to start, the traffic and health concerns will only get worse."" The resident added that a rela­tive of theirs suffered from bad hay fever attacks. ""There is so much dust. When I drive through, I cannot even see what's behind me. The least they could do is spray some water on the road to reduce the amount of dust,"" another resident suggested. Yesterday, after Times of Malta sent questions to IM, workers doused the road with water. In a statement, IM said ""works included the deep trenching for a new sewer trunk main and the addition of a new sewer rising main along the site. This factor has substantially compromised the final completion period of works, being in the critical path of the project."" Besides this, IM said that as the contractor was instructed to open one lane on the road, this further delayed the project. On the narrow concrete road, a road rage incident on June 29 led to the death of Jean Paul Busuttil. Mohamed Hamdan is accused of driving the wrong way down the road, colliding with Busuttil, then fatally shooting him after retrieving a firearm from his home.",https://cdn-attachments.timesofmalta.com/6c2f5c20f99b7d4ca5d94d5cf746ae5a81f32055-1758383079-bb455c52-1920x1280.jpg,"The noticeboard on site states that the project was scheduled to last 18 weeks from its start on January 30, meaning it should have been completed by early June.",2025-09-21 04:45:49.185495+00,"{Infrastructure,Mosta,National,Roads,Traffic}",{}

He told Times Talk that his plan is to target the vote of young people who feel disenfranchised by politics. In light of this and rumours of an early general election circling, Times of Malta visited GF Abela Junior College during Freshers' Week on Thursday to ask students what types of policies would encourage them to go out and vote. ""I would vote for the party that promises to make Malta, Malta again,"" one student said, adding that the ongoing development and the new buildings emerging lack a sense of Maltese identity and culture.

Students shared these thoughts following a summer when tensions surrounding ""overtourism"" escalated.

""The prices of everything keep on going up and the wages remain the same and it's becoming too costly to actually enjoy yourself while you're living,"" she said. Traffic...  Responses showed that improving the public transport system and reducing traffic remains a hot topic for young people. ""It's a bit difficult to get to school because of bus times and delays. I think we just need more bus stops in general,"" one student said. Apart from buses, one student called for the implementation of the metro, which the prime minister has recently hinted at again after having been quietly shelved. Rather than improving public transport, other students called for policies that steer away from car use.

The incident occurred at a renovation site near Plaza Mayor, a busy area in the heart of the Spanish capital.
Search underway for missing workers
Firefighters and rescue teams were deployed immediately after several floors of the building gave way, causing a cascade collapse that reached the basement level.
According to Francisco Martín Aguirre, the central government's representative in the Madrid region, the damage was ""very severe"", and assessments were underway to determine whether neighbouring buildings had been compromised.
Deputy Mayor Inmaculada Sanz said that search efforts were ongoing for four missing individuals, three men and one woman. Emergency responders were using drones to scan the wreckage while nearby properties were being evacuated as a precaution.
Initial reports from Madrid's emergency services indicated that three workers had sustained injuries, none of which were serious. Mayor José Luis Martínez-Almeida later confirmed that one of the injured had been taken to hospital.
Earlier estimates from Martín Aguirre suggested that up to 10 people might have been hurt, but municipal authorities later revised the figure down to three. Emergency officials maintained that all injuries were minor.
Witness accounts
The collapse sent shockwaves through the surrounding streets. Witnesses described hearing a powerful explosion before a massive cloud of dust engulfed the area.
""There was an enormous blast that shattered all the glass,"" said Milagros García Benito, who works at a nearby hair salon. ""You couldn't see a thing, everything was white. Then the firefighters and police arrived almost immediately.""
Police cordoned off the site, which was soon filled with ambulances, fire engines, and emergency personnel as crowds of onlookers gathered.
Sanz warned that the rescue and stabilisation work would be extensive, stating that ""the amount of rubble is very significant"" and that operations ""will last quite some time, possibly several days"".
The building, originally an office block, was being converted into a hotel after receiving planning approval from Madrid City Hall in February. Land registry data lists the structure as a six-storey property covering roughly 6,745 square metres (about 73,000 square feet).
Investigation underway
Authorities have not yet determined the cause of the collapse. Engineers and safety inspectors were expected to begin a detailed assessment once rescue operations concluded.
The Madrid municipal police said surrounding buildings would remain evacuated until stability could be guaranteed.
Emergency services continue to work at the site, prioritising the search for the missing workers amid concerns about further structural instability.

New poll data published by Times of Malta suggests frustration with traffic-related issues has reached new heights, with people citing them as both the country's biggest problem as well as the biggest hassle in their own personal lives.  And while irregular migration numbers are at record lows, many still cited 'asylum seekers' as the country's biggest problem. When coupled with mentions of 'illegal immigration', the issue ranks among the top concerns for people both on a national and individual level, cutting across party lines.  Concerns about corruption, which in previous years were regularly cited as a major national issue, appear to have waned and people are now more likely to cite the environment as a major issue  Senior citizens, on the other hand, appear to be the most satisfied citizens of all: 22.1 per cent were unable to name a single biggest problem impacting their life at the moment.",https://cdn-attachments.timesofmalta.com/861ca5e763c729e29a2eff224ebd167a14f789cb-1760183162-4abd07cd-1920x1280.png,Cars in the Santa Venera tunnel.

496733,https://timesofmalta.com/article/employer-cleared-responsibility-young-worker-death.1117838,Times of Malta,https://timesofmalta.com,Employer cleared of responsibility for young worker's death,"Court raps police, OHSA for not working together on the investigation of the case",Monique Agius,14/10/2025,"A court has sharply criticised the police and the Occupational Health and Safety Authority for not working together to properly establish the facts which led to the death of young worker Matthew Bartolo in the accident at Constructure Furniture 10 years ago. Magistrate Claire Stafrace Zammit made her comments as Construct Furniture director John Agius, floor manager Amanda Cefai and foreman James Cefai were acquitted of involuntary homicide. Agius was convicted of having engaged Bartolo without undertaking a risk assessment and fined €7,000.  All the accused were acquitted of failing to keep proper records, perjury, suppressing the evidence of a crime, and providing false information to the Occupational Health and Safety Authority (OHSA). Agius was also acquitted of recidivism.  The court in its considerations said that the prosecution in such cases needed to prove that there was a link between an alleged shortcoming by the accused and the employee, and that their acts of commission or omission caused the fatal incident. While Agius was the director of the company which engaged Bartolo on January 12, 2025, there was no evidence that Bartolo was employed by the Cefais. All that transpired from the evidence was that they were both at the factory when the fatal incident occurred. A court-appointed expert had reported that the machine did not have any issues. In its judgement, the court said it did not understand how the prosecution did not consider the conclusions of the court-appointed expert, and did not take criminal action against Nick Bellizzi, the engineer who certified the machine in 2012, and who should have carried out a risk assessment of the full machine.  It was clear that Bellizzi was responsible for the health and safety of the machinery, with the prosecution having failed to show whether Construct Furniture had a health and safety officer. From the evidence it emerged that Agius was working on the basis of instructions issued by Bellizzi. Had there been any shortcomings, the accused was not alerted to them by the engineer.  The court also noted that Agius had installed a safety barrier to the machine out of his own will, showing that he was ""serious"" in his work, contrary to Bellizzi.  It therefore acquitted all three accused of the main charge of involuntary homicide. It also acquitted the Cefais of the charges related to health and safety, finding that there was no contractual link between them and the victim. With regards to Agius, the court said the situation was different since there was an employment contract. While Agius made use of Bellizzi's services, he was not exonerated from his own duties. During the proceedings no documents were presented to show that Bartolo had undergone medical tests before being employed. It also emerged that the instructions on how to use the machine were not observed prior to the incident, with the court referring to the conclusions of a technical expert. In his testimony, Agius had said that Bartolo could have sought to place the wood on the machine in a better manner. Instead of stopping the machine altogether, he had jumped over the barrier and slipped.  On the basis of the available instructions to workers, the court ruled that Agius had done his utmost to ensure a safe working environment. Blundell should have been answerable to the shortcomings and not Agius, the court said. Agius was found guilty of employing Bartolo without a prior risk assessment  and without ensuring that he was assigned adequate work. The trio were acquitted of forging Bartolo's signature on the employment contract, with the court noting that the court-appointed expert was never asked to carry out a comparative exercise on Bartolo's signatures. Nor had the prosecution proven that the accused were making use of a fake employment contract. Agius was also not found guilty of recidivism after the prosecution did not present the judgement by which he had been found guilty earlier. This was the second prosecution in connection with the case. In 2023 David Peter Blundell, 50, who had been working alongside the 17-year old, was acquitted of failing to take all necessary health and safety measures during the operation of the machine. He was cleared of responsibility for the death. The court in its latest sentence rapped the prosecution and the Occupational Health and Safety Authority for not having worked together in the investigations of this case to establish what happened that led to Bartolo's death. Despite so many years having passed, the court said it still did not have a clear picture of the unfortunate accident that led to the loss of life of someone just started out in life. ""This court hopes that nowadays the two entities are working effectively together and for the benefit of society,"" the court said. Agius was fined €7,000 and acquitted of the other charges. The Cefais were acquitted of all the charges. Magistrate Claire Stafrace Zammit presided. Police superintendent Hubert Cini and inspector Joseph Mercieca prosecuted. Lawyers Veronique Dalli, Edward Gatt and Pio Valletta appeared for the accused. Lawyer Jason Azzopard, Kris Busietta and Alessandro Farrugia appeared for Bartolo's family.

British tourist, Liam Joseph Stacey, was charged in July accused of causing grievous bodily harm during a brawl involving a group of allegedly drunk and aggressive Maltese patrons at the hotel. During the proceedings, it had emerged that the scene unfolded after Stacey was slapped in the face by one of the Maltese men, causing him to fall over his toddler. Stacey got up and allegedly punched the man, later identified as Roderick Sciortino, in retaliation.  The only visible mark was a small bruise on the back of Sciortino's head, which was unrelated to the brain bleed and likely sustained when he fell. A consultant neurosurgeon confirmed that scans revealed a ruptured aneurysm -  a weakened arterial wall - that was not trauma-related. ""It was a purely pathological bleed, not due to an injury,"" Scerri said. He added that Sciortino's blood pressure was recorded at 200, high enough to rupture an artery, and his alcohol levels were elevated. Magistrate Donatella Frendo Dimech presided. The prosecution was led by AG lawyer Brandon Bonnici, assisted by police inspectors Bradley Grima and Clayton Camilleri. Lawyer Stefano Filletti assisted the accused.
