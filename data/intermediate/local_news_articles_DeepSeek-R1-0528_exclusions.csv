The first collapse happened in Qawra in the early hours of Monday morning, just two hours after the owner of a popular bar on Imrejkba Street had called last orders and closed for the night.  The balcony of the third-floor apartment fell onto the second-floor apartment's balcony, causing both to crash down onto the bar's terrace below. Two days later, a stone balcony in Zabbar collapsed onto the pavement below. No one was injured in either incident. The block where the Qawra collapse occurred is located next door to a construction site where 39 apartments and 33 garages are being developed. Following the collapse, the Building and Construction Authority (BCA) issued a stop works notice for the site. However, the notice was reversed soon after and works were allowed to continue. On Thursday, the BCA confirmed that after a professional assessment, it had deemed that work on the site was not responsible for the collapse of the balconies.  The architect said regular inspections were part of a wider overhaul of the regulatory processes and standards involved in the building and construction industry that the chamber had been working on. Point 10 of these proposals calls for ""post-occupancy checks and audits to be undertaken as pre-determined by the Building and Construction Authority to ensure the continued compliance of the structure with building regulations"". Such checks, Pizzuto said, could also include compliance with fire safety regulations, as well as the electrical wiring and lifts of a property. ""How often these checks occur, and whether they are also carried out on existing buildings is something the government would have to decide on. Ultimately, it has to weigh the cost of carrying out such inspections against the risk of further collapses,"" he said, adding that disused buildings and those located near the sea should be checked even more frequently.",https://cdn-attachments.timesofmalta.com/01a4361c1d9a9464ec6cfbff9a0bbf74c908b960-1743439651-32749ebd-1920x1280.jpg,"Debris in High Street, Sliema, after a balcony collapsed in 2021.

We still don't have a plan for a mass-transit system. Before the election the government spent €2 million promoting a metro, and now says it isn't a priority,"" he said.  Turning to two-wheeled transport methods such as cycling, Sammut said that the necessary infrastructure had to be in place before commuters were encouraged to make the switch.  ""Instead, the transport minister says, 'We'll see depending on how many people take up the incentives',"" he said, adding that people's biggest worry was the lack of safety on the roads.  Sammut insisted that the Opposition agreed with several of the government's proposals because it had proposed them itself years ago, namely rubbish collection outside of peak hours, the plan to add a cargo-only shipping route between Malta and Gozo, as well as national strategies on walking and cycling.  ""On the other hand, we disagree with increasing Transport Malta's budget by an exorbitant amount. People are not being hired and promoted because they are competent and experienced, but because they are die-hard Labour supporters or people suggested by the minister or Castille,"" he said.   Sammut said that if the government wanted to tackle traffic, it needed to shift the country's economic model away from the importation of foreign labour.  Fellow PN MP David Agius said he was late to the start of the press conference because he himself got stuck in traffic following a collision in Marsa.  He called on the government to reverse its plan to increase the number of years after which a car is deemed to be classic from 30 to 35 years.  ""Not only will this increase the number of cars on the roads, since vintage cars can only be driven a maximum of 3,000 kilometres a year, but also because we believe this hobby should be supported,"" he said.  Consultation - PL In a statement issued Thursday evening, the Labour Party pointed out before the measures were launched consultation was held about the proposals with experts, social partners and the public.  The PL accused the PN of not wantintg transport to be addressed in Malta, adding that the opposition's mass transport option could take ""decades"" to implement.

The man was driving his Piaggio Vespa along Triq Ghar Lapsi on May 2, 2020, when he stumbled into a pothole, lost his balance and fell off the motorcycle. He was taken to Mater Dei Hospital where he was certified with grievous injuries. Following the incident, the man returned to Turkey since he needed treatment, and the coronavirus pandemic had hit. He also underwent several surgical interventions. As a result of the incident, he sustained permanent disability, which harmed his quality of life. The man eventually returned to Malta. Through his lawyers, he filed an application before the First Hall of the Civil Court, suing the Siggiewi Local Council and Infrastructure Malta. He requested the court to hold both responsible for the incident and order them to pay him damages. Both Infrastructure Malta and the Siggiewi local council argued that they were not suited, with the road agency arguing that the council was responsible for maintaining the road, while the local council argued that it was in the hands of the agency. In court, the man testified that as he was driving along Triq Ghar Lapsi, direction towards Dingli cliffs, a few meters after he turned the corner, the condition of the road changed dramatically. Who is responsible for the road? He described how the road level went down by a few metres before he drove into a pothole. Moreover, there were no signs that the road surface would deteriorate, and the man said he had no reason to believe that the road surface would change in such a manner. John Fenech from Elles Urban Services Ltd - a company engaged by the council to maintain the roads - acknowledged that the road was in a state of disrepair and it had to be resurfaced. He also testified that the damage to the road was primarily attributable to the frequent passage of heavy vehicles in the service of nearby quarries. He added that the road was not built to take the weight of the vehicles. A police constable similarly testified that the road was in a bad state, noting that there were several cracks in the asphalt and potholes. In establishing who was responsible for the road, the court heard architect David Vassallo from Infrastructure Malta. The witness said the road fell under the responsibility of the local council, however, the road agency intervened and issued an emergency allocation to contractor Philip Agius and Sons for €1.5 million, excluding VAT, in December 2020. The council's executive secretary, Ritianne Giorgino, told the court that while it was within the council's boundary, the local council is responsible for maintenance or patching works, while resurfacing falls under the responsibility of the local government. Referring to the mayor's affidavit, the court observed that while it was outlined that the council has several structures to monitor and ascertain that roads are kept in a good state of repair, this was not the case and notwithstanding the ""layers of surveillance adopted by the Council, somewhere down the line, somebody is not doing his job properly or else the technical operandi is not functioning."" The court reminded how the road is used by heavy vehicles and therefore, the road should have been monitored more closely and frequently. It also observed that it was only after the plaintiff was injured that the road was properly repaired. The court concluded that the council was wholly to blame for the accident.  When it came to calculating damages, it took into consideration that 21 months after the accident, the man's radial nerve did not make a full recovery, and this was most likely improbable. It also took into consideration the court-appointed expert's observations on the fracture of the distal tibia, which involved an articular surface of the ankle joint and will inevitably lead to arthritic change. The motorcyclist also ended up with substantial amounts of metal implants attached to the humerus and tibia. These foreign bodies provide a slightly increased risk of bone infection during bacetermia, according to the expert. After calculating the damages, the court declared the Siggiewi local council responsible for the incident and ordered it to pay the man €74,873. Mr Justice Toni Abela presided over the court.

Why?,Claudia Calleja,29/05/2025,"Photographing and sharing images of tragic accidents on social media is ""citizen journalism at its worst"" and highlights the urgent need to focus on digital education across the nation, according to experts in communication and human behaviour. The issue came to light once again following a recent fatal traffic accident in which a motorcyclist died on the spot. After the accident, graphic photos were shared extensively via WhatsApp. This had also happened some months ago when footage of another fatal accident, that involved a car losing control, made the rounds on social media. Prof. Anton Grech, clinical chairman of Mental Health Services, explained that while human curiosity in the case of unusual or dramatic situations is normal - a phenomenon known as rubbernecking - social media amplified this. These actions - of taking and sharing images of tragic situations - were a reflection of a larger situation, he said. Before social media existed there were 'celebrities' and 'spectators'. Social media brought with it a shift in which many people wanted to be protagonists. This was happening in a virtual environment that is saturated with content and, in which, in order to be seen and stand out, the content has to be attention-grabbing. ""In parallel with this, we are losing respect for the society around us. We saw this in a recent case when a man was threatening to jump off the Valletta bastions,"" he said, referring to the 2021 case when onlookers urged a man to jump from the edge of a Valletta bastion, with many filming the ordeal. ""Many people seize all opportunities to gain this recognition without respect for others,"" he said, adding that there was an urgent need to educate people on this matter. Prof. Brenda Murphy, a media and gender expert and founder of NGO Mediating Women, agreed that there was the urgent need for more media education - in schools and beyond - through curriculum and public campaigns. ""This is a public education issue - we need to re-establish digital boundaries. We need to remind people that our duty of care doesn't disappear when we are online,"" she said. Such cases, she said, were ""citizen journalism at its worst"" as they offered ""a great snapshot of the widening gaps in 'news production'"". ""Journalists and editors are trained, educated, bound by professional regulation - citizens operate without any of these guardrails. While citizen journalism was lauded as a great liberator for information - this is an example of a great backfire,"" she said. A deeply problematic phenomenon Murphy explained that the sharing of such images was a ""deeply problematic phenomenon"" that reflects multiple pressures converging at the moment. From a digital culture perspective, she said, we are living in a world where everything is documented, and the boundary between private and public is becoming increasingly eroded. ""In the case of tragic moments, there seems to be an underlying belief that if something shocking happens, it should be recorded and shared. The algorithms that drive social media amplify this. They reward visibility, and sadly that includes tragic events,"" she said. Then there was the conversation on media ethics.  ""We may have the capacity to capture something digitally, but that doesn't mean we should. Sharing media content has become so normalised it completely breaches the private-public boundary. We need to be mindful that sharing a traumatic event compounds trauma - not just for the family and friends but the wider community is impacted too. We cannot justify this 'norm drift' by saying 'it's already out there, so it's ok to repost',"" she said.",https://cdn-attachments.timesofmalta.com/f302addf97be4fc26709e2b49a5e720146591bf8-1748449827-81b636e5-1920x1280.jpg,Sharing media content has become so normalised it completely breaches the private-public boundary.

New policing unit plans to find out,The unit has dealt with one fatality and 20 accidents involving injuries,Marc Galdes,06/06/2025,"A newly formed Road Policing Unit will be able to determine how and whether the quality of the roads are contributing to traffic accidents.  During a media briefing on Friday, the unit demonstrated how it works. A police car is equipped with a special device linked to a gyroscope on the roof. As the car drives over the road, the device measures the quality of the road surface. During the demonstration, a car sped down the road towards a mock traffic accident and made a sudden stop. The device within the car printed out a piece of paper that included data that helps police understand if poor road conditions may have played a role in a crash. They also need to take other factors into account, such as whether the road is wet or sloped.  They placed numbered yellow cones, which help to identify the evidence as investigations are carried out later on. Depending on the gravity of the situation, the police might even deploy a drone to get a shot of the accident and the surrounding area. The pictures the drone takes can then be used to develop a 3D image of the site, which is then reviewed in their offices. The data collected from this investigation is then passed on to the magistrate who is dealing with the case.

The report highlights a grim reality: fire engines and ambulances have no clear access, and pedestrians are being forced into oncoming traffic. Thousands of people use the stretch of road daily. ""The fact that this situation has been allowed to develop into its current state shows a total lack of consideration given to safety of anyone,"" a report by Shield Consultants said. Sliema resident Anna Maria Baldacchino, a member of the Sliema Residents Group, lives on The Strand - located on Triq ix-Xatt along Sliema and Gzira - and decided to commission the study herself. The street is lined with restaurants and bars that have built outdoor catering areas protruding into the road, leaving a gap between the building and the outdoor area to allow for a public pavement. Speaking to Times of Malta, Baldacchino said this began last year when an apartment adjacent to hers caught fire, but the fire engines were unable to open their ladders, so the firefighters were forced to gain access through the building. ""I was worried because obviously incidents happen and I always thought, if something had to happen what will be the outcome,"" Baldacchino said. She resorted to the authorities, however, she never received a straight answer about any form of risk management study. ""Nothing happened. At the end of the day, my life and the lives of other residents are at stake here,"" she said. 'High risk of a traffic collision' The report goes into detail about how the extension of the outdoor areas creates a hazard for cars driving on the inner lane which tend to steer their cars towards the outer lane increasing the ""probability of a collision"". The situation also becomes more dangerous if there is a delivery vehicle, which is forced to stop in the middle of the road, as there are no loading bays available. Signed by fire risk management consultant Andre Muscat, the report further noted how the outdoor structures block the view of anyone who wishes to cross at the pedestrian crossing. ""Pedestrians need to walk onto the road in order to be seen by approaching vehicles,"" the report said.  Given all the obstacles, the report raised serious concerns about the increased risk people face in the event of a fire or other emergency. ""There is also the risk of a fire starting in, or spreading to, the outside extension,"" the report added. The report noted that these catering establishments are surrounded by residential buildings with only one stairway for access. If residents were forced to evacuate, this would cause ""great congestion and confusion"". The report also questioned whether a fire engine would have enough space to utilise hydraulic platforms or turntable ladders, given the protruding canopy. The number of obstructions might also further delay emergency responders from reaching the residents.

""This week I was given the first draft of the legislation, so pretty soon I will be presenting it to cabinet,"" Chris Bonett told Times of Malta late last week. Bonett's statement comes weeks after the police set up their own body to investigate road collisions. At the end of May, the government announced the Roads Policing Unit, a specialised police department to enforce traffic rules and investigate the causes of major traffic accidents. Police officers received specialised training, while new equipment has been procured to facilitate the gathering and analysis of evidence, ranging from driving methods to road conditions. On Friday, Transport Minister Bonett said the two bodies will work hand in hand. ""There are two types of investigation that are carried out. First of all, to see what led to an accident, and second, to see what happens next... the idea is to work together,"" he said. Bonett later clarified that the bureau's main task will be to analyse how to make roads safer and recommend changes. He said discussions on where one body's remit begins and ends are ongoing. ""The idea is that the (police) unit and the bureau help each other to better service the public."" A bureau to investigate traffic collisions and recommend changes was first announced by Bonett's predecessor, Aaron Farrugia, in December 2022, on the back of Malta's deadliest year on the road. In 2025, 11 people have so far died in traffic incidents: four pedestrians, three car drivers, three motorcyclists and one cyclist. The bureau was meant to be up and running by the end of 2023 but ran into delays because of the judiciary's hesitancy to share the contents of magisterial inquiries. In February, Bonett told Times of Malta that a provision in the magisterial inquiry reform will give the Traffic Investigation Bureau the ability to gather information from inquiries.",https://cdn-attachments.timesofmalta.com/bc80af1e1cdcbeba889e03851379dd49894be3ae-1751212222-5d624827-1920x1280.jpg,Transport minister Chris Bonett,2025-07-02 10:10:09.622652+00,"{Accident,National,Traffic,Transport}",{}

In the face of this, the [transport] minister remains silent,"" he said, reiterating PN's call for a national action plan on road safety.  Sammut offered several explanations for the root cause of traffic accidents, including motorists getting frustrated by delays and congestion, and a lack of education on the rules of the road.   ""But the primary cause is a lack of law enforcement. The fact is that you barely ever see traffic officers. We need effective and continuous enforcement, not just during the Christmas period. To make matters worse, penalties are not harsh enough for people who kill and maim pedestrians.""  He added that the number of motorists driving under the influence of alcohol and drugs, especially cannabis and cocaine, was also on the rise.  If the PN were elected to government, Sammut said, it would prioritise the sector with a series of specific measures, such as launching an education campaign on how to share the road, while providing better infrastructure for cyclists and motorcyclists.   Sammut also observed that the transport safety investigative commission, first mooted in 2023, had still not been set up.  'Reports of incidents at sea have more than doubled'  Meanwhile, PN spokesman for maritime affairs Ivan Castillo said Malta's seas were also becoming more unsafe, citing figures that showed maritime incidents had increased from 17 to 41 in the space of just four years.   ""Enforcement is not increasing at the same rate. There is a clear problem with resources dedicated to enforcement and safety at sea. It's impossible for officers to keep up with the increasing number of vessels navigating our seas,"" Castillo said.  He recalled that the government had spent 100,000 on RHIBs, the vessels used by TM's Maritime Division, after five rigid hull inflatable boats that were bought for €721,000 were subsequently found to be unseaworthy.  Darren Carabott, the shadow minister for home affairs, said that every accident meant there were family and friends who were grieving or waiting desperately for good news from hospital.  ""We can have the best laws on paper, but they are for nothing if there is no proper enforcement,"" he said.  On Saturday, a 27-year-old motorcyclist was killed in a traffic accident in Pembroke. The following day, a 62-year old woman died when she was trapped between two cars in a crash in Floriana. Three fatalities in three separate incidents occurred the following day. A 71-year-old woman lost her life following a crash in Fgura, which also involved Prime Minister Robert Abela's mother and father.   Later on Sunday, a 58-year-old man lost control of his Honda motorcycle in Pietà before crashing into a pavement. He died soon after. And that evening, a 62-year old woman died when she was trapped between two cars in a crash in Valletta. Her husband is in critical condition. On Tuesday, a 63-year-old Tallinja driving instructor was killed when a bus rolled back on him at the Floriana park and ride facility. The man, Karmenu Muscat, was a former footballer who played for Malta's national team.  And last week, a 79-year-old woman died in an accident in Lija.  Cycling group lists proposals for road safety In a separate statement on Wednesday, the Rota cycling group also called for immediate action to tackle the situation on the roads, pointing out that Malta is on a devastating trajectory to exceed the 2022 record of 26 road deaths in a year. ""We cannot continue to treat road deaths as isolated incidents or unfortunate inevitabilities. These are systemic failures: failures in enforcement, infrastructure design, and in political will,"" the group said. The group said road design must be such that it prioritised the safety of all users, especially the most vulnerable: pedestrians and cyclists.  Malta also needed law enforcement that matched the scale of the crisis. ""It is absurd that the Malta Police Force is expected to carry out effective enforcement with only 18 breathalysers at its disposal. Road safety is not achieved through slogans-it requires proper resources, strong policy, and sustained enforcement,"" it said. The group suggested the immediate rollout of average speed cameras, not just single-point speedtraps; implementation and enforcement of 30 km/h zones in all urban areas; regular, well-resourced spot checks and sobriety testing; proper maintenance of roads, pavements and cycle lanes and proper law enforcement, including fines that reflected the gravity of endangering human life. Legislative reform The group also called for stricter penalties for motorists responsible for killing or seriously injuring pedestrians or cyclists and the introduction of presumed liability, a principle already in place across most EU member states, which places greater responsibility on drivers in the event of collisions with vulnerable users",https://cdn-attachments.timesofmalta.com/7db98e22e8e4f777d2bca3bbcc3995fdd7908c11-1753883471-6a59e6d9-1920x1280.jpg,The Nationalist Party reiterated its call for a national action plan on road safety.

In a statement, the Insurance Association Malta said it ""fully supports"" Mater Dei emergency department doctor Jonathan Joslin ""regarding the urgent need for stronger enforcement and deterrents to address drink and drug driving on our roads."" Joslin called for random testing of motorists in an article published in Monday's Times of Malta, when he described the lack of legal provisions for such testing as a ""critical gap"" in enforcement. Referencing data collected by its members in 2022 that found that only around three per cent of serious traffic accidents saw the use of breathalysers, the association said the situation ""remains a cause for concern"". It noted it had ""long advocated for more robust enforcement in this area"", including participating in the Malta Road Safety Council and proposing legal amendments putting roadside drug testing on the same level of importance as alcohol testing. The association said it ""remains committed to supporting road safety measures, as demonstrated in the past with the donation of breathalyser equipment"". ""We continue to call on authorities to prioritise investment in the resources and training needed to enable police to carry out consistent, effective roadside testing, particularly in the context of serious traffic accidents.""  It stressed that a ""visible and active police presence is not a sign of excessive enforcement but rather a proven deterrent against dangerous driving behaviour"", noting evidence showed that increased monitoring of motorists during the festive season ""directly contributes to improved outcomes"". The association urged authorities to ""implement both alcohol and drug testing measures more systematically and without delay"". ""Road safety is a shared responsibility-and it deserves unwavering commitment."" Joslin said the country should urgently introduce legal provisions allowing police to conduct random breath and saliva testing for alcohol and drugs, with a shift away from the requirement of ""reasonable suspicion"" essential to deter would-be offenders. The doctor also said the police must have a visible and routine presence on the roads, with random checkpoints, unmarked patrol vehicles, mobile testing units and immediate roadside suspensions of drivers who fail tests.

Data compiled by transport activist Paolo Cassar Manghi shows that no other seven-day period since at least 2000 has recorded so many road deaths. Cassar Manghi, a transport researcher and road safety advocate, described the spike in fatalities as ""tragic but not surprising"", warning that the country's road infrastructure often encourages speed rather than discouraging risk. Among the six victims were a driving instructor crushed by a runaway bus, a motorcyclist and a pedestrian killed in a crash involving a parked car. On the same week, three others were killed in unrelated violent incidents, in one of the bloodiest weeks in Malta on record. On July 23, a 79-year-old woman from Mosta died after the Renault van she was a passenger in crashed with a Suzuki Swift car in Lija. Three days later, Tenyo Kosev died when his Honda motorcycle was involved in a collision with a BMW 1 Series motorcycle in Pembroke at around 1am. Last Sunday, three people died. Mildred Azzopardi was crushed to death after a vehicle ploughed into a parked car, fatally hitting the 62-year-old. Azzopardi's husband, Alfred, was critically injured. Benjamin Chetcuti, who was driving the car that hit the Azzopardis, is facing charges of manslaughter and driving under the influence of alcohol. The other two victims were a motorcyclist and a car passenger who was involved in a collision with a car driven by former president George Abela with his wife Margaret in the passenger seat.

The statement comes after Magistrate Joe Mifsud called for random roadside alcohol and drug testing of drivers, after a fatal Senglea motorcycle crash, which took place in June, revealed the rider had cocaine in his system.  The National Alcohol Policy was launched in June to reduce alcohol consumption in the population through ""evidence-based strategies"". The Association said it welcomed the policy's release for public consultation, but raised its concern that the publication, which was delayed by 17 months, is a signal of the authorities' lack of urgency, and how it left out a dedicated section on drink-driving found in the 2018-2023 policy.   The Association pointed to the policy's own data showing that alcohol consumption in Malta rose by 23 per cent between 2010 and 2019, while the European average fell by roughly the same percentage. Almost half of those aged 20 to 49 admit to drinking more than six glasses of alcohol each week.  ""The policy acknowledges rising alcohol use across all age groups, yet remains practically silent on the sanctions and enforcement that are crucial to deterring repeat offenders. Education alone is the carrot, but without the stick of enforcement, it will not be enough,"" IAM said.  The Association urged the government to follow the lead of other European countries, which were implementing tougher laws to curb drink-driving, including random roadside checks and stricter penalties, such as higher fines and licence suspensions.  It also called for mandatory reporting of driving-under-the-influence cases to insurers. It also called for the introduction of Alcolock devices, a breathalyser installed in a vehicle that would prevent the engine from starting if the driver is over the legal limit. It also suggested introducing subsidised taxi services during large events, coupled with campaigns to promote designated drivers. Finally, it suggested greater use of CCTV footage to identify and deter dangerous behaviour on the roads.  ""Educating drivers on the risks is vital, but it must be matched by strong deterrents that make repeat offences far less likely,"" IAM said.  The statement comes following a spate of serious road accidents in recent weeks, several linked to drink-driving. The Association also called on the authorities to ensure that the new National Alcohol Policy delivered meaningful change, warning that ""without decisive measures, Malta risks relegating this policy to another missed opportunity, and drink-driving will remain a deadly, preventable threat on our roads"" In July, AFM soldier Benjamin Chetcuti was allegedly five times over the alcohol limit when his car hit 62-year-old Mildred Azzopardi in Valletta, killing her and injuring her husband.

ACE added that it also supported calls by Caritas for strict ID card checks in supermarkets, groceries and catering establishments.  ""Above all, ACE also supports the recent call for a public education campaign aimed at clarifying the risks associated with alcohol consumption and driving to remind the public that any amount of alcohol in the bloodstream can impair their ability to drive safely.""  The association stressed that road safety is a collective effort which calls on government, legislators, political parties, civil society and individuals to ensure safer roads, better enforcement and fewer deaths.  On Monday, the Malta Hotels and Restaurants Association also came out in support of revising laws to allow police to conduct random substance testing.  ""MHRA stresses that for a country like Malta, where tourism is a cornerstone of the economy, safety is not optional; it is essential,"" the association said.  In a recent inquiry into the death of a motorcyclist who was found to have cocaine in his system, Magistrate Joe Mifsud endorsed a 2023 position paper co-written by NGO Doctors For Road Safety, the Maltese Association of Psychiatry and the Foundation for Welfare Services on drug-driving under the influence of psychoactive drugs.   Mifsud endorsed each of the paper's eight recommendations, including the introduction of a legal framework to enable random drug testing for psychoactive substances, as well as the random screening of professional drivers, such as taxi, school bus, coach and heavy machinery drivers.",https://cdn-attachments.timesofmalta.com/cf2760b36a1af4450b72b4f1fc0371805d5827da-1755767096-c2ca6b93-1920x1280.jpg,"Currently, police can only administer a breathalyser test if they have reasonable suspicion that a motorist is intoxicated.

The statements came in the wake of another accident caused by drink-driving when a car, driven by a Brazilian man, crashed head on into an oncoming bus in the opposite lane on Tower Road in Sliema. The car driver was four times over the alcohol limit.  Michael Spiteri, who was attending to the first call out of the day at just before 6am on Thursday in the wake of the Sliema accident, warned this could ""have ended in tragedy"". ""Irresponsible drivers are putting innocent lives at risk. It is obvious that some are refusing to learn, so the only way forward is random and frequent checks, harsh penalties, and highly visible enforcement to deter this reckless behaviour. This country should act to reduce preventable injuries and deaths,"" Spiteri said. In a number of proposals to address the issue, the Opposition insisted on ""zero tolerance"" for accidents caused by drivers who are found to be under the influence of alcohol or drugs, stronger law enforcement, harsher penalties and the introduction of a ""new specific criminal offence"" for causing death or grievous bodily harm due to gross negligence, recklessness and/or dangerous driving. This offence would carry a minimum penalty of five years' effective imprisonment, rising up to life imprisonment in cases with aggravating factors, the PN said. Currently, the Police Force has 18 breathalysers, while LESA has five breathalyser kits, all of which only detect alcohol. The PN said the number of road-testing devices ""must be increased"" and kits that detect drugs should be added. ""This is a real and serious problem on our roads,"" the PN said. They also highlighted the shortage of staff allocated in the police traffic section and urged for greater investment in the police force, the traffic section and the authorities responsible for road enforcement.

At present motorists are only tested after accidents or when there is 'reasonable suspicion' that they may be driving under the influence. ""Random Testing is the true deterrent in decreasing injury and death on Malta's roads,"" Joslin, leading consultant at the Mater Dei emergency department, wrote in a Facebook post.  ""While higher fines and stronger punishments may act as one layer of deterrence, experts insist that the real game-changer lies in random roadside alcohol and drug testing. This must be applied before a collision happens, not only after injury or death has occurred. ""Protection, not reaction, must be the guiding principle. Drivers must understand that the risk of being caught under the influence does not depend solely on the tragic aftermath of a crash. It must be clear, publicly and categorically, that anyone can be stopped at any time, tested on the spot, and face serious legal consequences if found guilty,"" the doctor stressed. He said the prime minister's reform must therefore ensure that random roadside testing for all vehicles becomes the central deterrent.  ""Only then will Malta send the strongest possible message: if you drive under the influence, you will be caught - and the consequences will be severe.

In a statement, the council said, ""some weeks ago, one of the arches of the historic aqueduct located in our locality collapsed due to a traffic accident that occurred in the area"". While no further details about the accident were provided, in July part of the historic Wignacourt aqueduct in Mriehel was closed off for checks after a truck hit one of the arches as it joined the Rabat road. An architect was appointed by the Superintendence of Cultural Heritage to evaluate and prepare a report on the damage, with repair works to be carried out ""by the relevant authorities"", the council said.  ""The council wishes to emphasise that it is not within its remit to carry out these works, nor does it hold any legal or technical responsibility for the repair of the arch"", it said. ""Nevertheless, the council has been actively and continuously putting pressure and engaging to ensure that these works are undertaken as soon as possible."" The council said the pending repairs were ""particularly important"" due to the new school year starting later this month, with it ""very aware of the traffic pressure that already exists in the area - pressure that has increased due to the closure of this arch"". It ""strongly appealed"" to authorities ""to make every effort to ensure that the necessary works are carried out without further delay"". The Birkirkara community and residents ""deserve a serious and immediate solution to this inconvenience that has persisted for too long"", the council said. The aqueduct was built on the orders of Grand Master Wignacourt, for whom it is named, to carry water from springs in Dingli and Rabat to Valletta. It was inaugurated in April 1615. This is not the first time the historic structure was damaged; in August 2018, one of the arches was damaged when the driver of a large concrete-mix truck ignored traffic signs and tried to drive through, damaging the central corbel stone of the arch.

Mgiebah Bay, in Mellieha's Selmun area, is a swimming spot favoured by those wanting to avoid crowds. Pictures posted on social media and others taken by Times of Malta show deep cracks in rock formations just above a flat, clay part of Mgiebah that is popular with bathers.  Frenki Dragan Crnjakovic, who flagged the issue on the Facebook group 'The BEST of Malta', said he highlighted the issue last year. ""A huge chunk of rock is waiting for its moment to crash into the sea. I wrote about this last year but it seems my post didn't reach many people. Be kind - share with your friends. I believe that it will also reach the official services that will mark or fence off these dangerous areas,"" he said.  Mellieha mayor Gabriel Micallef said he first reported the issue to the police and several government entities last April. He pointed to a particular rock formation that seemed close to dislodging onto the crowd. By May, a report commissioned by the police and drawn up by the Public Works Department's Project Design and Engineering Directorate confirmed the danger. ""It has been observed that large boulders are gradually becoming dislodged due to ongoing coastal erosion,"" the report, dated May 9, says. ""This natural process is giving rise to areas that pose a significant risk to public safety, especially as the summer season approaches and the bay is expected to attract a high number of visitors for sunbathing and swimming,"" it says. The report said that, besides the cracks in the rock formation highlighted by Micallef, other rock formations in other parts of the bay were dangerous. ""In view of the above, I strongly recommend that a qualified geotechnical engineer be urgently commissioned to carry out a comprehensive assessment of the site. The objective of this evaluation should be to identify zones of potential danger and advise on any necessary mitigation measures,"" the report says. ""Given the imminent increase in public use of this location, this assessment should be undertaken as soon as possible to prevent any avoidable incidents."" Correspondence provided to Times of Malta by the Mellieha mayor shows that the Lands Authority was alerted to the problem. Micallef said that the last communication he had from the authority was in June, when the Lands Authority and the council agreed to install danger signs. ""Kindly note that danger signs have been ordered and I will update you with the date of installation,"" the e-mail, dated June 24, said. Questions have been sent to the lands ministry. Last year, 22-year-old Mirabelle Falzon died when she was hit by falling rocks at a popular spot in an area known as Munxar, in the limits of St Thomas Bay. The ruins of an 18th-century military battery, known as Rihama, are perched on the cliff overlooking the site. After the incident, several signs were put up, warning that swimming in the area is prohibited, and a fence was erected around the battery itself.  A magisterial inquiry into the tragedy said reports about the dangerous state of the coastal battery in Marsascala, made in the months and years before the collapse killed Falzon, were lost in the bureaucracy of government entities.  The magistrate recommended that a single entity should be responsible for receiving reports about state-owned and private buildings, as well as abandoned buildings and structures like bastions and cliffs that presented a danger to the public.

Calls for tougher legislation reached a crescendo this summer following a spate of traffic accidents in which the motorists involved were found to have been driving under the influence of drink or drugs. But Home Affairs Minister Byron Camilleri told the House that the government had declared its intention to beef up the laws even before parliament rose for the summer recess. ""We want to send a clear message to motorists that they cannot, through their actions, put others in danger,"" he said.  Motorists and pedestrians who observed the law deserved protection, he said, and while one could not control what everybody did or did not do, this legislation would serve as a stronger deterrent. Going into the provisions of the law, Camilleri said that henceforth, the police would be able to test motorists for drug abuse in the same way as they did for alcohol. And tests could be carried out randomly and not upon 'reasonable suspicion' as had been the case to date for drink-driving. Limits were not being changed, the minister said, but there would be 'zero tolerance' for anyone driving under the influence of illegal drugs such as cocaine or heroin. The minister pointed out that during talks with a number of organisations, concerns had been raised about how this new approach could negatively affect people taking medical cannabis who were perfectly fit to drive but could still be caught up in the tests. Similarly, people who took recreational cannabis days previously could also be caught up. There was also a risk that people would  not take medicines prescribed by doctors for fear of being caught up in drug tests.  A well-researched document had been handed to the government and was being seriously considered.  The purpose of the new law was to ensure that everyone was responsible behind the wheel and to deter only those who were unfit to drive. But there would be zero tolerance of those who were reckless and prepared to put other people's lives in danger. No risks could be taken, which was why random testing was now also being introduced.   The minister said the police had bought new, modern test kits for drug testing. The procedure to be followed was that in the case of a positive drug test, a follow-up test would be taken to confirm the result. The new law also provided that when a traffic accident resulted in a fatality, the motorist would be sentenced to jail if convicted of having been driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs. The possibility of a suspended sentence was being removed. Stiffer fines There would also be stiffer fines for those found to be driving under the influence of drugs or alcohol. The purpose was to strengthen the deterrent against those who, through their recklessness, risked injuring or killing somebody. A fine which previously stood at €1,800 was now being raised to €2,500 for a first offence. In a repeat offence, the current fine of €3,000 was being raised to €5,000. Furthermore, prosecutors may request immediate suspension of a motorist's driving licence, not when proceedings are completed. The law was also introducing stiffer penalties in hit-and-run cases.  In his address Camilleri said this was not the first time that the government was taking tough action to ensure that traffic laws were observed. Penalties for contraventions that could put people's lives in danger had actually been doubled in 2023. But strengthening the law had to be accompanied by actual enforcement, and this was happening too, with just the police having mounted 1,300 road checks this year up to August. Action would increase even more now that the police had a specialised Road Policing Unit.  10,000 found driving while on the phone this year  Action by the police and others such as LESA was not just focused on drink and drug driving. This year, up to August,10,000 fines were issued against motorists found using mobile phones at the wheel. 38,000 had been fined for this offence since 2022. All these people, clearly, were prepared to drive in a manner which endangered others, despite heavy fines, the minister said.  This underlined the need for educational campaigns to underscore the point that people should not put other people's lives at risk. ""The message is clear, the mobile phone can wait and if you drink or take drugs, your place is not behind the steering wheel,"" Camilleri said. ""Do not play with people's lives"".",https://cdn-attachments.timesofmalta.com/19ec136d08358bd3d8b6f72389bfce2c53910a60-1758033532-664deb4e-1920x1280.png,Home Affairs Minister Byron Camilleri speaking in parliament on Tuesday.,2025-09-16 15:04:54.616951+00,"{Drugs,National,Traffic}",{}

Motiraj Paudel suffered head injuries in what witnesses described as an unprovoked attack in the early hours of Sunday, at the corner of Triq San Gorg and Triq L. Apap. The 43-year-old from Nepal said he was driving along the road when he found it blocked by a badly parked white Mercedes ""half on the pavement and half in the road"". ""When I told the driver he was parked illegally, he and another man got out of the car and one of them punched me three or four times in the head,"" Paudel told Times of Malta. He was knocked out and, after coming to his senses a minute later, a group of women who had witnessed the assault called an ambulance, which took him to Mater Dei Hospital for treatment. ""The [taxi] driver was completely peaceful and did nothing to provoke the attack,"" a shocked witness said. ""We went to the police station immediately to report what we saw but they did not ask for any ID or contact details,"" she added. A police spokesperson said a report had not been filed at the time of writing but the victim said he thought his medical report would be sent to the police. Paudel, who was forced to take time off work due to his injuries, said he had been living in Malta for the past six years. 'Racist insults but never a physical assault' He said that, in his four years working as a bus driver and two years as a taxi driver, he had experienced occasional racist insults but never a physical assault. ""I just asked him politely to move. This isn't how you should resolve problems in a civilised country,"" he said. The incident follows another reported case of road rage that occurred two days prior, in which three people were involved in a brawl in the middle of Triq Manwel Dimech, in Sliema. Those involved ultimately chose not to pursue the matter with a police report, opting instead to apologise.
