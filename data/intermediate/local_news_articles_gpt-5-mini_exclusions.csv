The first collapse happened in Qawra in the early hours of Monday morning, just two hours after the owner of a popular bar on Imrejkba Street had called last orders and closed for the night.  The balcony of the third-floor apartment fell onto the second-floor apartment's balcony, causing both to crash down onto the bar's terrace below. Two days later, a stone balcony in Zabbar collapsed onto the pavement below. No one was injured in either incident. The block where the Qawra collapse occurred is located next door to a construction site where 39 apartments and 33 garages are being developed. Following the collapse, the Building and Construction Authority (BCA) issued a stop works notice for the site. However, the notice was reversed soon after and works were allowed to continue. On Thursday, the BCA confirmed that after a professional assessment, it had deemed that work on the site was not responsible for the collapse of the balconies.  The architect said regular inspections were part of a wider overhaul of the regulatory processes and standards involved in the building and construction industry that the chamber had been working on. Point 10 of these proposals calls for ""post-occupancy checks and audits to be undertaken as pre-determined by the Building and Construction Authority to ensure the continued compliance of the structure with building regulations"". Such checks, Pizzuto said, could also include compliance with fire safety regulations, as well as the electrical wiring and lifts of a property. ""How often these checks occur, and whether they are also carried out on existing buildings is something the government would have to decide on. Ultimately, it has to weigh the cost of carrying out such inspections against the risk of further collapses,"" he said, adding that disused buildings and those located near the sea should be checked even more frequently.",https://cdn-attachments.timesofmalta.com/01a4361c1d9a9464ec6cfbff9a0bbf74c908b960-1743439651-32749ebd-1920x1280.jpg,"Debris in High Street, Sliema, after a balcony collapsed in 2021.

We still don't have a plan for a mass-transit system. Before the election the government spent €2 million promoting a metro, and now says it isn't a priority,"" he said.  Turning to two-wheeled transport methods such as cycling, Sammut said that the necessary infrastructure had to be in place before commuters were encouraged to make the switch.  ""Instead, the transport minister says, 'We'll see depending on how many people take up the incentives',"" he said, adding that people's biggest worry was the lack of safety on the roads.  Sammut insisted that the Opposition agreed with several of the government's proposals because it had proposed them itself years ago, namely rubbish collection outside of peak hours, the plan to add a cargo-only shipping route between Malta and Gozo, as well as national strategies on walking and cycling.  ""On the other hand, we disagree with increasing Transport Malta's budget by an exorbitant amount. People are not being hired and promoted because they are competent and experienced, but because they are die-hard Labour supporters or people suggested by the minister or Castille,"" he said.   Sammut said that if the government wanted to tackle traffic, it needed to shift the country's economic model away from the importation of foreign labour.  Fellow PN MP David Agius said he was late to the start of the press conference because he himself got stuck in traffic following a collision in Marsa.  He called on the government to reverse its plan to increase the number of years after which a car is deemed to be classic from 30 to 35 years.  ""Not only will this increase the number of cars on the roads, since vintage cars can only be driven a maximum of 3,000 kilometres a year, but also because we believe this hobby should be supported,"" he said.  Consultation - PL In a statement issued Thursday evening, the Labour Party pointed out before the measures were launched consultation was held about the proposals with experts, social partners and the public.  The PL accused the PN of not wantintg transport to be addressed in Malta, adding that the opposition's mass transport option could take ""decades"" to implement. ""The current needs are of no interest for them,"" the Labour Party said.",https://cdn-attachments.timesofmalta.com/1f0dff275831534b5a03d60c09841b7a7da22aa3-1743686575-b247451c-1920x1280.jpg,PN's Mark Anthony Sammut said the government had failed to divulge the precise targets of its incentives.

Why?,Claudia Calleja,29/05/2025,"Photographing and sharing images of tragic accidents on social media is ""citizen journalism at its worst"" and highlights the urgent need to focus on digital education across the nation, according to experts in communication and human behaviour. The issue came to light once again following a recent fatal traffic accident in which a motorcyclist died on the spot. After the accident, graphic photos were shared extensively via WhatsApp. This had also happened some months ago when footage of another fatal accident, that involved a car losing control, made the rounds on social media. Prof. Anton Grech, clinical chairman of Mental Health Services, explained that while human curiosity in the case of unusual or dramatic situations is normal - a phenomenon known as rubbernecking - social media amplified this. These actions - of taking and sharing images of tragic situations - were a reflection of a larger situation, he said. Before social media existed there were 'celebrities' and 'spectators'. Social media brought with it a shift in which many people wanted to be protagonists. This was happening in a virtual environment that is saturated with content and, in which, in order to be seen and stand out, the content has to be attention-grabbing. ""In parallel with this, we are losing respect for the society around us. We saw this in a recent case when a man was threatening to jump off the Valletta bastions,"" he said, referring to the 2021 case when onlookers urged a man to jump from the edge of a Valletta bastion, with many filming the ordeal. ""Many people seize all opportunities to gain this recognition without respect for others,"" he said, adding that there was an urgent need to educate people on this matter. Prof. Brenda Murphy, a media and gender expert and founder of NGO Mediating Women, agreed that there was the urgent need for more media education - in schools and beyond - through curriculum and public campaigns. ""This is a public education issue - we need to re-establish digital boundaries. We need to remind people that our duty of care doesn't disappear when we are online,"" she said. Such cases, she said, were ""citizen journalism at its worst"" as they offered ""a great snapshot of the widening gaps in 'news production'"". ""Journalists and editors are trained, educated, bound by professional regulation - citizens operate without any of these guardrails. While citizen journalism was lauded as a great liberator for information - this is an example of a great backfire,"" she said. A deeply problematic phenomenon Murphy explained that the sharing of such images was a ""deeply problematic phenomenon"" that reflects multiple pressures converging at the moment. From a digital culture perspective, she said, we are living in a world where everything is documented, and the boundary between private and public is becoming increasingly eroded. ""In the case of tragic moments, there seems to be an underlying belief that if something shocking happens, it should be recorded and shared. The algorithms that drive social media amplify this. They reward visibility, and sadly that includes tragic events,"" she said. Then there was the conversation on media ethics.  ""We may have the capacity to capture something digitally, but that doesn't mean we should. Sharing media content has become so normalised it completely breaches the private-public boundary. We need to be mindful that sharing a traumatic event compounds trauma - not just for the family and friends but the wider community is impacted too. We cannot justify this 'norm drift' by saying 'it's already out there, so it's ok to repost',"" she said.",https://cdn-attachments.timesofmalta.com/f302addf97be4fc26709e2b49a5e720146591bf8-1748449827-81b636e5-1920x1280.jpg,Sharing media content has become so normalised it completely breaches the private-public boundary.

The report highlights a grim reality: fire engines and ambulances have no clear access, and pedestrians are being forced into oncoming traffic. Thousands of people use the stretch of road daily. ""The fact that this situation has been allowed to develop into its current state shows a total lack of consideration given to safety of anyone,"" a report by Shield Consultants said. Sliema resident Anna Maria Baldacchino, a member of the Sliema Residents Group, lives on The Strand - located on Triq ix-Xatt along Sliema and Gzira - and decided to commission the study herself. The street is lined with restaurants and bars that have built outdoor catering areas protruding into the road, leaving a gap between the building and the outdoor area to allow for a public pavement. Speaking to Times of Malta, Baldacchino said this began last year when an apartment adjacent to hers caught fire, but the fire engines were unable to open their ladders, so the firefighters were forced to gain access through the building. ""I was worried because obviously incidents happen and I always thought, if something had to happen what will be the outcome,"" Baldacchino said. She resorted to the authorities, however, she never received a straight answer about any form of risk management study. ""Nothing happened. At the end of the day, my life and the lives of other residents are at stake here,"" she said. 'High risk of a traffic collision' The report goes into detail about how the extension of the outdoor areas creates a hazard for cars driving on the inner lane which tend to steer their cars towards the outer lane increasing the ""probability of a collision"". The situation also becomes more dangerous if there is a delivery vehicle, which is forced to stop in the middle of the road, as there are no loading bays available. Signed by fire risk management consultant Andre Muscat, the report further noted how the outdoor structures block the view of anyone who wishes to cross at the pedestrian crossing. ""Pedestrians need to walk onto the road in order to be seen by approaching vehicles,"" the report said.  Given all the obstacles, the report raised serious concerns about the increased risk people face in the event of a fire or other emergency. ""There is also the risk of a fire starting in, or spreading to, the outside extension,"" the report added. The report noted that these catering establishments are surrounded by residential buildings with only one stairway for access. If residents were forced to evacuate, this would cause ""great congestion and confusion"". The report also questioned whether a fire engine would have enough space to utilise hydraulic platforms or turntable ladders, given the protruding canopy. The number of obstructions might also further delay emergency responders from reaching the residents. It added that ambulances might find difficulty parking near the building and further difficulty to get a stretcher through the ""crowded and congested environment"". Pavement is hazardous for people with mobility difficulties The obstructed and congested pavement also endangers the elderly and individuals with mobility impairments, the report flagged. It also mentioned the difficulties of walking on the pavement with young children and describing passing through with a pushchair as being ""almost impossible"". In the report's conclusion it said: ""The conditions reviewed and reported in the report constitute several instances of a clear and present hazard laden with catastrophic risk potential from the road users to the pedestrians to the residents and even to the customers of the establishments themselves. ""Unless brought under control quickly, the situation is only bound to get worse,"" the report concluded. This is not the first time Baldacchino has challenged these outdoor structures. In January 2024, she said she applied for permission to take up public land where the restaurant Gourmet Cocktail Bar & Grill had an outdoor seating structure that had been operating illegally for around a decade. Later that month, the Planning Authority approved a permit to sanction the restaurant canopy. Earlier this year, Baldacchino gave a passionate speech in the European Parliament about noise pollution caused by bars and restaurants.",https://cdn-attachments.timesofmalta.com/83d0a44f271bd268dff6b06b69a1a3872efc4ab1-1749311684-bf24f11a-1920x1280.jpeg,"Fire engines and ambulances have no clear access, and pedestrians are forced into oncoming traffic.",2025-07-03 14:58:49.139238+00,"{Accident,""Food And Drink"",National,Sliema}",{}

""This week I was given the first draft of the legislation, so pretty soon I will be presenting it to cabinet,"" Chris Bonett told Times of Malta late last week. Bonett's statement comes weeks after the police set up their own body to investigate road collisions. At the end of May, the government announced the Roads Policing Unit, a specialised police department to enforce traffic rules and investigate the causes of major traffic accidents. Police officers received specialised training, while new equipment has been procured to facilitate the gathering and analysis of evidence, ranging from driving methods to road conditions. On Friday, Transport Minister Bonett said the two bodies will work hand in hand. ""There are two types of investigation that are carried out. First of all, to see what led to an accident, and second, to see what happens next... the idea is to work together,"" he said. Bonett later clarified that the bureau's main task will be to analyse how to make roads safer and recommend changes. He said discussions on where one body's remit begins and ends are ongoing. ""The idea is that the (police) unit and the bureau help each other to better service the public."" A bureau to investigate traffic collisions and recommend changes was first announced by Bonett's predecessor, Aaron Farrugia, in December 2022, on the back of Malta's deadliest year on the road. In 2025, 11 people have so far died in traffic incidents: four pedestrians, three car drivers, three motorcyclists and one cyclist. The bureau was meant to be up and running by the end of 2023 but ran into delays because of the judiciary's hesitancy to share the contents of magisterial inquiries. In February, Bonett told Times of Malta that a provision in the magisterial inquiry reform will give the Traffic Investigation Bureau the ability to gather information from inquiries.",https://cdn-attachments.timesofmalta.com/bc80af1e1cdcbeba889e03851379dd49894be3ae-1751212222-5d624827-1920x1280.jpg,Transport minister Chris Bonett,2025-07-02 10:10:09.622652+00,"{Accident,National,Traffic,Transport}",{}

Mgiebah Bay, in Mellieha's Selmun area, is a swimming spot favoured by those wanting to avoid crowds. Pictures posted on social media and others taken by Times of Malta show deep cracks in rock formations just above a flat, clay part of Mgiebah that is popular with bathers.  Frenki Dragan Crnjakovic, who flagged the issue on the Facebook group 'The BEST of Malta', said he highlighted the issue last year. ""A huge chunk of rock is waiting for its moment to crash into the sea. I wrote about this last year but it seems my post didn't reach many people. Be kind - share with your friends. I believe that it will also reach the official services that will mark or fence off these dangerous areas,"" he said.  Mellieha mayor Gabriel Micallef said he first reported the issue to the police and several government entities last April. He pointed to a particular rock formation that seemed close to dislodging onto the crowd. By May, a report commissioned by the police and drawn up by the Public Works Department's Project Design and Engineering Directorate confirmed the danger. ""It has been observed that large boulders are gradually becoming dislodged due to ongoing coastal erosion,"" the report, dated May 9, says. ""This natural process is giving rise to areas that pose a significant risk to public safety, especially as the summer season approaches and the bay is expected to attract a high number of visitors for sunbathing and swimming,"" it says. The report said that, besides the cracks in the rock formation highlighted by Micallef, other rock formations in other parts of the bay were dangerous. ""In view of the above, I strongly recommend that a qualified geotechnical engineer be urgently commissioned to carry out a comprehensive assessment of the site. The objective of this evaluation should be to identify zones of potential danger and advise on any necessary mitigation measures,"" the report says. ""Given the imminent increase in public use of this location, this assessment should be undertaken as soon as possible to prevent any avoidable incidents."" Correspondence provided to Times of Malta by the Mellieha mayor shows that the Lands Authority was alerted to the problem. Micallef said that the last communication he had from the authority was in June, when the Lands Authority and the council agreed to install danger signs. ""Kindly note that danger signs have been ordered and I will update you with the date of installation,"" the e-mail, dated June 24, said. Questions have been sent to the lands ministry. Last year, 22-year-old Mirabelle Falzon died when she was hit by falling rocks at a popular spot in an area known as Munxar, in the limits of St Thomas Bay. The ruins of an 18th-century military battery, known as Rihama, are perched on the cliff overlooking the site. After the incident, several signs were put up, warning that swimming in the area is prohibited, and a fence was erected around the battery itself.  A magisterial inquiry into the tragedy said reports about the dangerous state of the coastal battery in Marsascala, made in the months and years before the collapse killed Falzon, were lost in the bureaucracy of government entities.  The magistrate recommended that a single entity should be responsible for receiving reports about state-owned and private buildings, as well as abandoned buildings and structures like bastions and cliffs that presented a danger to the public. In a statement reacting to the conclusions, the government said it will be implementing the court's recommendation for there to be one entity ""that will receive reports about government buildings or private buildings, as well as about walls, cliffs, or abandoned buildings that pose a danger to the public"".",https://cdn-attachments.timesofmalta.com/0191d72a735c9d4c5aab804d2c674bdd585860ae-1757481590-792c9e79-1920x1280.jpg,The site at risk of a potentially deadly rockfall.

281,493920,https://timesofmalta.com/article/tougher-measures-reckless-drivers-go-parliament.1116252,Times of Malta,https://timesofmalta.com,Tougher measures against reckless drivers go before parliament,We want to bring about a culture change and introduce effective deterrents - minister,Times of Malta,16/09/2025,"A bill to introduce random testing of motorists for drug and alcohol abuse went before parliament on Tuesday, with the Home Affairs Minister insisting that the changes had been in the works for some months. Calls for tougher legislation reached a crescendo this summer following a spate of traffic accidents in which the motorists involved were found to have been driving under the influence of drink or drugs. But Home Affairs Minister Byron Camilleri told the House that the government had declared its intention to beef up the laws even before parliament rose for the summer recess. ""We want to send a clear message to motorists that they cannot, through their actions, put others in danger,"" he said.  Motorists and pedestrians who observed the law deserved protection, he said, and while one could not control what everybody did or did not do, this legislation would serve as a stronger deterrent. Going into the provisions of the law, Camilleri said that henceforth, the police would be able to test motorists for drug abuse in the same way as they did for alcohol. And tests could be carried out randomly and not upon 'reasonable suspicion' as had been the case to date for drink-driving. Limits were not being changed, the minister said, but there would be 'zero tolerance' for anyone driving under the influence of illegal drugs such as cocaine or heroin. The minister pointed out that during talks with a number of organisations, concerns had been raised about how this new approach could negatively affect people taking medical cannabis who were perfectly fit to drive but could still be caught up in the tests. Similarly, people who took recreational cannabis days previously could also be caught up. There was also a risk that people would  not take medicines prescribed by doctors for fear of being caught up in drug tests.  A well-researched document had been handed to the government and was being seriously considered.  The purpose of the new law was to ensure that everyone was responsible behind the wheel and to deter only those who were unfit to drive. But there would be zero tolerance of those who were reckless and prepared to put other people's lives in danger. No risks could be taken, which was why random testing was now also being introduced.   The minister said the police had bought new, modern test kits for drug testing. The procedure to be followed was that in the case of a positive drug test, a follow-up test would be taken to confirm the result. The new law also provided that when a traffic accident resulted in a fatality, the motorist would be sentenced to jail if convicted of having been driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs. The possibility of a suspended sentence was being removed. Stiffer fines There would also be stiffer fines for those found to be driving under the influence of drugs or alcohol. The purpose was to strengthen the deterrent against those who, through their recklessness, risked injuring or killing somebody. A fine which previously stood at €1,800 was now being raised to €2,500 for a first offence. In a repeat offence, the current fine of €3,000 was being raised to €5,000. Furthermore, prosecutors may request immediate suspension of a motorist's driving licence, not when proceedings are completed. The law was also introducing stiffer penalties in hit-and-run cases.  In his address Camilleri said this was not the first time that the government was taking tough action to ensure that traffic laws were observed. Penalties for contraventions that could put people's lives in danger had actually been doubled in 2023. But strengthening the law had to be accompanied by actual enforcement, and this was happening too, with just the police having mounted 1,300 road checks this year up to August. Action would increase even more now that the police had a specialised Road Policing Unit.  10,000 found driving while on the phone this year  Action by the police and others such as LESA was not just focused on drink and drug driving. This year, up to August,10,000 fines were issued against motorists found using mobile phones at the wheel. 38,000 had been fined for this offence since 2022. All these people, clearly, were prepared to drive in a manner which endangered others, despite heavy fines, the minister said.  This underlined the need for educational campaigns to underscore the point that people should not put other people's lives at risk. ""The message is clear, the mobile phone can wait and if you drink or take drugs, your place is not behind the steering wheel,"" Camilleri said. ""Do not play with people's lives"".",https://cdn-attachments.timesofmalta.com/19ec136d08358bd3d8b6f72389bfce2c53910a60-1758033532-664deb4e-1920x1280.png,Home Affairs Minister Byron Camilleri speaking in parliament on Tuesday.,2025-09-16 15:04:54.616951+00,"{Drugs,National,Traffic}",{}

The 43-year-old from Nepal said he was driving along the road when he found it blocked by a badly parked white Mercedes ""half on the pavement and half in the road"". ""When I told the driver he was parked illegally, he and another man got out of the car and one of them punched me three or four times in the head,"" Paudel told Times of Malta.

Paudel, who was forced to take time off work due to his injuries, said he had been living in Malta for the past six years. 'Racist insults but never a physical assault' He said that, in his four years working as a bus driver and two years as a taxi driver, he had experienced occasional racist insults but never a physical assault. ""I just asked him politely to move. This isn't how you should resolve problems in a civilised country,"" he said. The incident follows another reported case of road rage that occurred two days prior, in which three people were involved in a brawl in the middle of Triq Manwel Dimech, in Sliema. Those involved ultimately chose not to pursue the matter with a police report, opting instead to apologise. In May, dashcam footage captured a driver assaulting a tourist attempting to cross a zebra crossing, also in Sliema. In a separate case in June, a road rage dispute in Bidnija allegedly escalated into a fatal shooting.

Motorists reported spending more than double the usual time on their commutes on Tuesday, and many took to social media to express frustration, complaining about standstill traffic that stretched even onto non-arterial roads. In a Facebook post, Transport Malta said there were 23 collisions, 10 vehicle breakdowns and two separate spillages across the island on Tuesday. It said calls for assistance were more numerous than other days, and its officers were much busier trying to solve the gridlocks. And those are just the cases Transport Malta assisted in, and do not include accidents that were reported to LESA. However, it is unclear whether the traffic jams were linked to the high number of accidents.  Transport Malta constantly monitors the roads using scores of cameras scattered around the island, and it employs officers on foot, motorbikes and in cars to patrol and clear the roads whenever accidents occur. To ensure roads are cleared as quickly as possible, officers - and sometimes whole units - are immediately deployed to the scene of a crash or breakdown, or when heavy vehicles spill hazardous fluids, materials, or chemicals. Traffic frustration On Tuesday, several motorists on social media said a journey from Sliema to Marsa took up to 1.5 hours, the short hop from Ta' Xbiex to Msida was an hour-long ordeal, the route from San Gwann to Msida lasted 45 minutes, and drivers travelling from the Three Cities to Attard spent 1.5 hours stuck in traffic.  Key hotspots throughout the day included the St. Paul's Bay bypass, with heavy congestion along the Coast Road and in St Julian's. Furthermore, traffic was especially bad in Paola, Marsa's Aldo Moro Road, the Marsa/Hamrun bypass and Regional Road. Major traffic was also reported on most roads leading in and out of the Gzira, Ta' Xbiex, and Msida area, with vehicles barely moving. Parliament drama The day's traffic woes even spilled into an impromptu banter session in parliament later that day between Prime Minister Robert Abela and Opposition Leader Alex Borg. The drama began when government whip Naomi Cachia accused the opposition of raising a procedural issue simply to buy time for Borg to arrive, as he was running late. Borg eventually arrived mid-way through Abela's speech. When he took the floor, he told the Prime Minister he was delayed because, unlike Abela, he was stuck in traffic as he doesn't have an escort. Abela quickly hit back, telling Borg he ""better had his licence and insurance paid"". This was a reference to a recent incident involving Borg's partner, Sarah Bajada, who was caught driving without a valid vehicle licence and insurance.",https://cdn-attachments.timesofmalta.com/943b89ef823623cc61d972d5d1d3f97d74b4aead-1759934255-d5adee8a-1920x1280.png,Traffic was especially bad on Tuesday.
